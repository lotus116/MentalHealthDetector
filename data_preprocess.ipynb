Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family (who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much). Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression, paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me, dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide (though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to) and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous, my heart beats really fast, my limbs feel like jelly, heavy breathing, I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. Other than that though I'm quite optimistic and I tend to be a genuinely upbeat and happy person!

Today I lashed out at him by saying omg dad it’s cuz I’m wearing these pants today ( the pants which are wide, loos high waisted and make ass look bigger), instead of skinny jeans so I obv gained like 10 pounds or tonnes of kilos or whatever overnight. Later on he said “it’s so easy to make you mad you shouldn’t react that way just cus you don’t think you’re fat”  this made me think that he is doing this to get a rise out of me which isn’t cool for 55 yo dad or you know an adult. Or another reason is probably cuz he is getting older and living a sedentary lifestyle, it’s the holiday season and he put on weight he’s not doing anything about it and he’s taking it out on me, he’s a bit chubby but not like overly flabby it’s just most shirts don’t fit anymore.

The only thing that I need to do is get a job and save some money, but my parents have forbidden me from doing so. At the moment my prediction is to spend the year attending classes, applying for scholarships, and working during the day before couch hopping with a few friends for a month or 2 and spending the rest of the time staying in hostels when I can or sleeping on the streets when I can't before hopefully getting into college where I'll have a reliable bed.

I guess it's more rewarding to feel like I've \"earned\" the validation.\" In short, it seems like because of her past relationships, she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection, and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship, but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her).

I have always been in relationships where I was still able to be an independent unit and avoid too much commitment because I was always scared to lose my independence. But this is the first relationship where I feel like we're a really good fit, and it doesn't feel like a sacrifice I don't want to make.

By tomorrow night, I (21 y/o UK university student) have to email my dissertation supervisor a draft of what I have written so far; the deadline is in May and he wants to give me some feedback before the upcoming Easter break. But the problem is that I haven't written anything. At all. I've collated dozens of pages of general notes, vague ideas and research over the last few months, but I don't have a clue what to do with it, or where to start.\n",

      "I've written probably hundreds of assessments and essays in my life, and until a few weeks ago, I had not failed a single one of them. But a few weeks ago, my motivation, self-belief and general ability to work (which were all low to begin with anyway) just stopped altogether. I had deadlines for two course module assessments within a week of each other, and I missed both of them. For one of the first times in my education, I had not only failed with work, but I had failed to even complete the work. I missed the first one because I had zero interest in, knowledge of or care for the subject, because I kept procrastinating, and because it's possible that I have ADHD (I don't want to know about this, but I think I have it). I missed the second one because of the same reasons, and because I failed the first one, so it didn’t make a difference if I missed the second one.\n",

I don’t like thinking about it. I keep distracting myself from it (literally and mentally) because I don't want to do it. The subject itself interests me (it was my choice after all) and i’ve done a lot of research (too much I think) and every time I ever doubt my work ability like this (which is every time i’ve ever done an assessment in my three years at university) it usually turns out alright, but I can't see how this one — of course, the most important one — will end in anything other than failure. So I’ve come all this way — from the start of uni three years ago, from the start of reception 17 years ago — and I've always, at the very least, managed to succeed. But now of all times is when it stops.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m aware that every student who has ever tried to write a university thesis has had these doubts at some time, or a lot of the time. But that makes me feel all the more incapable. Because those students have all, and will all, get through it, and I know that I won't. I look around the university library that I'm currently writing this in, and all I see is people working; they’re focused, self-disciplined, and content to be here. But I’m not one of them. I know that I don’t belong here, and I don’t like it here. I really don't like coming here. But I come here nevertheless. I'm sitting here wasting more time on something that I don't have to do, that I shouldn't be doing, but I'm doing nevertheless. Because I think a part of me actually wants to fail. I don't know why anyone would want that, especially me; I've always feared failure — the confirmation of it by my university and parents; the consequences of it practically and emotionally — and that's what’s driven me to always succeed with my work in education. I've only ever done that work because I fear the consequences of not doing it. I do it because I have to, never because I wanted to. I've always been like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why am I here then? If you never enjoyed school or college (which i didn't) then why did you actively decide to go to university? Hmm. Maybe because I thought I had to (not because I wanted to pursue a career — I have absolutely no ambition at all). And it was partly because the idea of getting a job after I left college at 18 seemed completely impossible (I've suffered from social anxiety for most of my life; the basics of social interaction are overwhelming to me). But mostly, it was because I didn't think any of it through. I didn't want to think it through at all. My parents thought I could maybe go to this university, so I just said okay. I didn't even look into the university at all, and I didn't consider any others. The reason that I do this is because I hate thinking about the future — short, medium and long term. Whenever people ask me about the future, whether it’s “where do you see yourself in five years”, “what do you want to do with your life\" or even simply “do you have any plans for the weekend”, I’ve always given vague non-answers. I've been like this forever. Probably because I’ve been bombarded with these questions from career advisors since Year 1. But it's also because the future is too uncertain and complicated. It scares me to think about the future in any sort of way. So I don't. And now I'm paying the price. And the future gets closer every day. And I wish I could go back in time, maybe to live things differently, maybe to live them the same. I think about the past (my childhood especially) every day. And every single night I dream about the past too. The other day I had one about the last day of Year 11. I’ve had hundreds like it, all about the last day of secondary school. The thing that haunts me about it is the fact that I don’t remember what happened. All I remember is that I never saw any of my peers again after that day. Because I made the conscious decision to leave them, and go to a different college. Every single dream I have involves my old school friends. Every one.\n",
      "\n",
      "In case it isn't clear, my recent doubts over starting (let alone completing, or succeeding with) my dissertation are related to so many other things that I have consciously, often deliberately bottled up over the years (and it is years). I know how unhealthy and dangerous it is to do this, but I do it anyway because it's easier, and because it's been the default way of accepting, contemplating and processing my emotions for as long as I can remember. I've never had the desire to tell anyone (including family) about my most vulnerable thoughts and feelings, fears and insecurities, because…well…where to start? Fear of judgement, fear of being misunderstood, fear of being understood, fear of the literal and emotional consequences on myself and on my relationships; the fact that emotions were and are are never discussed in my family, or in the few social circles I used to have (note: haven't had friends for five years). I bottle all of this up. And I'll continue to. But it feels like the bottle is starting to overflow.\n",

      "If anyone has read this far, you might as well consider yourself the first person who has ever heard anything that is even remotely as private as what I've just revealed in these last few paragraphs. And if you've read this far — and if you are a healthy, ‘normal’ person — you will have obviously thought to yourself, “Yeah, he needs therapy”. But I don't think I do, and I certainly don't want to. There’s a small part of me that desires to let it all out (I could write a book about all of my problems), but I know that would be a terrifying and draining experience, even if it leads to something better. And the desire certainly isn't big enough for me to have serious thoughts about seeking help…from anyone in fact. I think that’s the bottom-line: regardless of whether I need help, or guidance, or advice, or support, or sympathy, I don't think I want it. Not enough, anyway. I think I’d hate myself for seeking it out because I'd feel like a desperately sad narcissist. I know I'm pathetic, dumb, probably annoying, an embarrassment, a failure, a waste of space, time, money and effort, but I don’t think I'm a narcissist. And I know that people who seek help aren't narcissistic, but I would think that I am if I did. So I don't. And I've never sought help from anyone. Not only the serious, personal stuff, but the little, trivial, specific things too. Is it because of a deep-rooted social anxiety, and my complete lack of social confidence, ability and experience? Yes. But like with my other anxieties that I probably ‘need’ help with — health anxiety, fear of the future, fear of the passage of time, the fear of failure, the fear of work, the fear of my dissertation — I don't care about help, or support, or self-improvement. I don’t want any of it because I think it won’t work for me, or that it doesn't apply to me. I don’t want to be helped. And yet here I am writing this.）：UNAUTHORIZED USER\n",

      "翻译失败（原文：Pretty bad anxiety towards taking meds with a possibility to prolong QT. Help. [Warning: this post got much, MUCH longe r than I anticipated. Sorry to however actually reads this entire essay.]\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I have a psychiatrist who recently prescribed me sertraline (for chronic depression/ptsd) and trazodone (for sleep) but I actually haven't taken either. This specific phobia started like 1-1 1/2 yrs ago I think. I had walking pneumonia a few weeks ago and absolutely had to take antibiotics and Holy shit, my anxiety was thru the roof every time I was time to take it.  I was absolutely convinced my QT interval was significantly prolonged and I was going to die in my sleep! I feel like I narrowly escaped death after I finished the course. Which is ridiculous.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had ekgs countless times, probably like over 10 times (ftr I'm only 18 and only started getting them in the last two years) and for the most part, were completely 100% normal (shocker).... excluding this one time during my purging like 3x a day and keeping literally nothing down phase where my hearts repolarization phase fucked beyond belief.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually I'm just going to talk about that a little because the anxiety still plagues me. my heart was physically rattling / shaking in my chest with every beat, like it was unsure of how to beat normally. it was incredibly scary, I think I experienced what I believe was possibly a very brief arrhythmia. at first I thought it may have been a minor seizure (which wouldn't be that unrealistic, as purging (electrolyte disturbances such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia.), sleep deprivation (I had stayed up all night), physical activity while literally running on empty (we were inside playing basketball when it all started) and of course hypoglycemia (essentially not-eating will do that to ya) all lower the seizure threshold, and also how i might have had a seizure once back when I was abusing dxm constantly which of course predisposes you to future seizures) because of how disoriented I got and how everything became slow motion, almost similar to the time distortion one would get on a psychedelic.\n",
      "\n",
      "......but that didn't explain how my heart rate was reaching 140 (for the record, throughout the last 2ish years that I have been measuring it, it has always, always sat at a comfy 55-60 while not using HR-raising drugs such as dxm or speed) when I got it taken in the nurses office in the psychiatric facility, and how I felt like I was about to die. When I went and got that ekg I believe actually traumatized me in a way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Coming fairly close to death (which has actually happened to me a numerous times,  with my purging phase, over exercising phase (I actually kept a fucking exercise bike in my tiny ass room and legit would use it non stop for 3-5 hours to burn off literally everything I ate and then some, feeling proud when my net calories for the day ended up in the negative. it was bad, real bad) restriction phase (I have eaten less than 500 calories / day for months at a time, several times, in fact I can feel a restriction phase coming on, as I am pushing myself to not eat, God I hate being eating disordered, but st this point it's a safety blanket after I've been dealing with this shit day n day out since 13 yrs old me first decided to eat like 100 calories a day for 2 or 3 months (can't rmmbr) cos I was obese. Cant really remember if I started out with disordered thinking and intentions, or if it just was a crash diet-turned weird obsession and addiction to weight loss. and also, this one non eating disorder related time I was riding in a car with my mom maybe 1 1/2 years ago , legit almost got tboned (we would have been hit on my/her side of the car, had we been just 2 seconds slower getting through the intersection, that person would have hit us. oddly enough, she was panicking, yet I f elt absolutely nothing, no adrenaline, no fear, nothing. I attribute that to how I learned to dissociate from everything at. A young age due to my father's husband abusing us constantly (lol dissociation as a coping mechanism is cool (not))\n",
      "\n",
      "I wholeheartedly believe I could have died if I continued with the purging (I still get extreme anxiety when I analyze that specific ekg I know I should throw it out but I just can't, I am a person who is very much into record keeping). I feel like I am not actually alive, that I died months / years ago, and this is maybe purgatory. I alternate between genuinely feeling like I should truly not be / am not actually alive, because of all of this shit. Not sure if that's connected to the ptsd or what. I mean, I was dxd with major depressive disorder with psychotic features, at one point. God my life is a nightmare. I so desperately wish to take the place of a normal person Ie didn't have an abusive biological father, isn't a piece of shit drug addict, doesn't harm themselves via eating habits and excessive exercise, doesn't have all these stupid ridiculous mental things. (how did my life end up like this.......) I fantasize about it alot. Normal people with normal lives take that shit for granted. It angers me. They just don't understand how goddamn lucky they fucking are, Holy fucking shit. \n",
      "\n",
      "(Oops, sorry for the going off on a total tangent. That happens to me sometimes.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway...How do I get over this.... I honestly would not take any med like that on a daily basis unless I had an at home ekg that I could use like 12 times a day. Actually, every time I discontinued an Ssri or antipsychotic it as because I could \"sense\" that my QT interval was prolonged. Even if the drug was helping me. It's horrible. I have a cardiologist appointment soon because I got minor chest pains during exercise a few weeks ago. Which doesn't sound particularly bad, but that, coupled with the knowledge of the fact that many people can have silent heart attacks and asymptomatic arrhythmias, it's downright terrifying. I am scared about what I might find out, if I mayhaps did permanent, structural, unfixable damage to my heart muscle from a only a several month long bulimic episode, and am now much, much more vulnerable to cardiac events.... I almost don't want to go. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now what's weird about this phobia, is that I currently am using Xanax at night and meth during the day and I'm also a smoker. Its weird how those three things are pretty not-good for you, yet I have less anxiety about smoking a cig or a bowl of meth than taking an anti depressant???!???\n",
      "\n",
      "It's so irrational and honestly I believe it's an ocd thing as I also tend to take my blood pressure 4-20 times a day (no fucking joke) and weigh my self constantly and also check my pulse to see if my heart rhythm is \"normal\" about 10x a day. My blood pressure is so good that even as I am fucking high out of my mind on meth and just smoked a cig, the highest it goes is like 130/85 (which, insanely and funnily enough, is still probably lower than like 70% of Americas blood pressure, lmao), which is just slightly hypertensive. It's normally, with only the Cigs and no meth, like 90/60, sometimes even like 85/57, no lie. I attribute it to my whole food/plant based diet. I'm not really sure why I still compulsively take my BP. But anyway This anxiety is destroying me. I really do think I need to be on an SSRI or something, but I guarantee I could not even take a single benadryl without panicking hardcore.\n",
      "\n",
      "So. Does anyone deal with this fear of an abnormal heart rhythm specifically? I just wonder how common it is. And how people deal with it. (/end Xanax fueled rant about my mental issues. I would be shocked if anyone actually reads this entire essay)）：UNAUTHORIZED USER\n",

      "翻译失败（原文：I no longer know what else to do but write this. I am not even sure what I expect to come of it except for hopefully support and sympathy and trying to see light at the end of this dark tunnel. I will preface this quickly with the fact that I am generally a very happy person, but I feel so defeated I do not know where else to turn. I have been with one woman the past 9 years of my life, and I am only 26. We have an immense story together over all that time, but I think like any person in my position, I thought we were going to last forever. We even share a kiddo together.When I learned she was pregnant, I really started to get my life together. We got married too around this time. I was working whatever jobs I possibly could, and I was always taking the next step forward to provide for my family. After about 2 years, and wanting more out of life, I overextended into a career I was not ready for. I made a few \"mistakes\" in their eyes and they politely asked me to leave. I was really devastated by this because it was a career I had put a lot of time and research into only for it to fall flat. Nevertheless, I pushed forward, and with constant strain from my wife's side of the family, I decided to move my family to my home state with the help of my side of the family. Things were no fairy tale, however. Our living situation was very bad, especially with a kiddo. Again, I started working, and only thanks to my best friend willing to let us stay in his home were we able to salvage the situation. For the first time in our relationship and marriage, my wife got a job with me while my mom watched our kiddo. We worked very hard together, and I cherish those memories a lot. I think due to all of the stress, we both decided to start smoking weed. I think she was 24, and I was 22 at the time. We were a very straight edge couple before then. Anyway, after about 3 months, we were back on our feet, but once we had our own place again and bills to pay, the financial strain started to hit again even with us both working. Mostly because of the long drive to get work and very little hours. I asked our boss for a raise and she said no, despite us working there for 6 months and always going above and beyond what was asked of us while others slacked, slept on the job, and had us covering their messes. We quit promptly, and afraid of losing our situation again, I uttered the words: \"If I have to work fast food, I will.\" Well, I ate those words quickly. With no other job prospects in sight, I literally had to work at a fast food restaurant up the street despite all my prior work experience. I hated it at first. My wife and I played a lot of video games together, and in an attempt to better ourselves we started livestreaming. We had mild success together, but it was not enough to pay the bills. The thought of coming home to livestream after my horrid job was the only thing pushing me through. Once again with this job, I would actually run the entire restaurant with maybe just one other person while the managers would sit in the back. I did dishes, cleaned disgusting grease traps over and over, cooked all the food at the highest quality, and trained new members because people would quit left and right. I did this for about 6 months praying that our livestreaming would pay any sort of dividend. Despite the immense effort we had put into building a quality livestream and building a community, we just could not get it off the ground. I started heavily abusing marijuana because I felt so lost, and it made me feel good even when things were not good. I think with being the age I was, and the drug use, I started to experience a severe break in my mental health. Therapy resolved the issues almost entirely, but I did do pretty severe damage to my family as a whole while they carried me through that low point. No meds, no more weed, and I was back on track. Just to add a little more to that last section of the story too, I was really banking on being a popular enough streamer to get by in life. There was not anything else I wanted to do. However, smoking weed did open my mind to the thought of making music. When our streams would end unsuccessfully, I would get high, and stay awake another 4 hours or so into the night and write music even though I had never done such a thing my entire life. The music was pretty bad, but it was entertaining enough to keep me distracted while I tried to escape my struggles. I tried to become a manager at the restaurant, but somebody else always got promoted before me. Even people working there for 2 weeks were on the path to becoming a manager before I was. I did mention a lot that I was more interested in livestreaming or music panning out for me than I was working as a manager, but the thing was that I was literally doing the entire job anyway in hindsight. When I made an actual shot at it, I was told no. We had the worst skeleton crew you could ever imagine. Frustrated, I quit the restaurant, I quit livestreaming, I quit gaming, and actually caught a break getting a new sales job with an unlimited earning potential. I was still writing music as sort of a gag to show my friends and express my creativity. The sales job was a major blessing, but I sucked very bad at it. Every single person told me they were not interested in the product I was supposed to be selling. My sales manager actually commented about never seeing someone quite as bad as me at sales. It hurt me a lot, but I figured it just was not for me despite how much I loved the thrill of talking to people so directly and trying to get them excited about a product. I tried 2 sales jobs, and eventually found a chill job doing security work. I never forgot what I learned from my sales jobs. With all the time to think about my future at my new job, I finally decided to give my music career a real go. I would actually produce music on an old laptop in my car at the worksite. I had worked in almost every industry besides automotive and medical so I really did not know what else to try. This is where it all gets very interesting. My security job was reasonably getting my family by while I did this whole music thing. With the combination of all the things I had learned in the past, music was actually my greatest tool in the end. It helped me sell myself as a person to get the things I wanted. My music never spread the way I saw some others did. Millions of plays, thousands of plays, hell, I was lucky to even get 20 plays. It did not matter. I could show people my songs, socialize, and get everything I really wanted which was to be heard. I cannot express how much life was getting exponentially better day by day. I was so confident that my music was just one good ear away from either going viral or helping me to my next big opportunity. Naturally, with my charisma growing, my marriage getting stronger, and really selling myself as a true rockstar, I was ready to take things to the next level. My wife had discovered her bisexuality over the course of this time since starting to smoke weed. We talked about having experiences with other women, but as I am sure any person knows, it is difficult to swing getting lucky with one person, let alone two at the same time. I saw it as a good challenge, but never expected it to work. After a solid year at my security job, I had produced so much music. I loved every single song so much, and still I was not able to really turn a profit on anything. I did have one song reach 100,000 plays, but it hardly translated into any traction as far as followers or return listeners. To reiterate, I was more focused on how I could use music as a tool to gain the interest of another woman in my life rather than money. I met many different women, had wonderful experiences, but my wife and I really wanted to be with someone the way we were with each other. Long term, committed, etc. Before long, we actually had attracted someone. We talked for about a month, and made things official. We were all dating as a \"triad.\" If you could not guess, as a man, living like this was heaven on Earth. I even found a job in this automotive parts factory making great money while I worked on my next huge musical project. Unfortunately, dating like this with all the new emotions really tore me up at times. I experienced a lot of jealousy while I provided on the job side of things while my girlfriend and wife stayed at home. My mental health broke down again for the first time in years, and out of paranoia, I broke up with my girlfriend. She was pissed at me, and did not take being broken up with lightly. I regretted my decision within days, and begged her to come back. She declined over and over. My wife and her kept seeing each other while I worked, and I mostly found it fair just because of the mistakes I had made. I was determined to show my girlfriend that I still loved her and make amends. I leveraged my factory work into an even better factory job making more money and with one of the most solid companies nationwide. I drastically improved myself as a person, and I even found a confidence being \"alone\" like never before. My wife actually missed the 3 of us being together just as much as I did, and then she convinced my ex-girlfriend to give me another chance. To celebrate, I took them on a vacation to a beautiful beach condominium. We all grew closer, and I even decided to try smoking weed again with my ladies after being sober for like 2 years. I had never been so high in my entire life, I was literally shaking and could barely even use the microwave to make myself food. It felt like the most earned vacation of a lifetime even in my own head. I had an extremely pleasant thought that was something like: \"Wow, I am really just a normal guy with nobody coming after me to hurt me being like this. I can just live my life and enjoy this heaven forever.\" Our relationships peaked so hard here. I was actually in heaven, with only a little paranoia of my nontraditional dating habits coming back to bite me in some way. Great money, 2 beautiful women, my credit was building to buy a house, and a new album ready to be dropped on the horizons. With my relationships settled, the only thing I was really suffering in was the typical 9-5 work in a factory which had nothing to do with the career I actually wanted: music. With a sizable savings to give my music all the promotion, hard work, and love it really needed, I quit my factory job. I told my ladies, and they were very apprehensive. This is where things take a drastic turn for the worst. Little did I know, my chicks were still actually having some issues regarding the whole relationship. It came in a way I could have least expected. My wife, the person I had been through thick and thin with for 9 years, came out as being fully gay. It makes my stomach turn to even think about how they sat me on the bed to tell me that. I thought I had done something wrong to mess things up, or they were mad about the job, but no. It was something entirely out of my control. My girlfriend looked at me with sorrow because she knew it meant it was over for us too even though we had just fixed things. I wrote the song \"Mistakes Are Lessons\" as the final flex that despite not making a mainstream appearance, I was living the life that every dude on Earth could have dreamed of. The beat came first, but I did not finish the 2nd half of the lyrics until I had been broken up with which is why they are kind of somber sounding. I am now going through a divorce, I am unemployed, and despite searching for a job, I cannot find one. Even if I could, I am almost completely spent as a person. I had a short run going back to school thinking I wanted to be a doctor, but after studying biology, it really just hammered into me more that I need to pursue my passion of music. The only energy I have left to give this world is my music and my story. I am scared writing this because at the moment I have $24 in my bank account. I have never reached such a rock bottom in my life. The hardest, most depressing thought of my life is returning to the typical work grind where I have to hide my real personality. People always made me feel like I had to live and experience things to create great music, so that is what I went and did. I know there is still more experiences to be had, but I feel like I have learned lessons no man my age should know. I have gone from living in heaven to feeling like a slug. I do not know what else to do. Believe it or not, there is so many details I left out of this story I would love to tell, but it is already long enough as is. On a happy note, I ended up in a long distance relationship with an amazing friend that I actually had been telling my life story to for months on end. She did not care about my past, and she was actually the first person to ever describe my music as \"beautiful.\" I really do try and make it that way sometimes, and she saw that. I have never loved someone as much as her. All I want out of life at this point is to tell my stories, listen to music, create music, perform music, and still be financially sound. that is really the whole baseline of this story too. I have been chasing financial freedom for years trying different things only to be taken advantage of time and time again. I just do not know if I can do it anymore. Being in this situation makes me feel like a failure as a Dad, a failure as a musician, and a failure as a person. Will I ever be enough? Financial Freedom）：UNAUTHORIZED USER\n",

      "翻译失败（原文：I have only 1 person I can somewhat open to but I have only done so to a certain extent and try to refrain from doing it at all for the most part. I feel guilty as if I am bothering them with unfairly dumping my bullshit onto them and as if I am doing it for attention or pity. I honestly have no clue how long this will end up being. Whether this story grosses you out, makes you hate me, or even if you choose not to read it, everything is fine with me. It does not really have a point. I just felt like Id never actually let my thoughts out properly and so this is my trashbin.Was raised in a single mother household and never knew my father. Mother divorced him for being psychotic and threatening not only her life but the lives of his children as well. This was after years of her holding out believing it was her duty to sacrifice herself to let her children have a financially stable home with 2 parents. We ended up in a very low class town with minimal income but my mother worked herself to the bone with low paying jobs in an attempt to make sure we still had as good of a life as she could make. Unfortunately I still ended up being a weird kid. Not really sure why but I have always wondered if I had a disorder that was simply never noticed and properly diagnosed. I know now though that I have severe anxiety problems which were hereditary. She spent every last ounce of her strength just trying to provide for the family so she had very little left over to actually raise the children. Once I got into the public elementary school my weirdness ended up with me never developing any connections. Eventually there was severe bullying. I would never paid any attention to it till my most recent years when I started to reflect on why I am the way I am now, but I know that some of it definitely mentally changed me in very not good ways. Though all these years I never thought of it as such. For what I believe was the reason above I ended up dropping out of the school system after at least a year of problems. The biggest was me refusing to go to school by faking epileptic seizures as a way to get out. I actually had epilepsy but all of the \"seizures\" I ever had at school were fake. The final nail in the coffin was 1 particularly violent bully beating the shit out of me and stomping my head into the concrete pavement for almost a minute like he was playing dance dance revolution at an arcade. Teacher was too scared to physically stop him I guess? Stayed out of the system for like 3-4 years while the public school shut down. We live in an extremely economically dead town. Like the majority of the towns roughly 1000 population are under the 10k annually mark (including us) and barely survive solely off government benefits and the low cost of living. That was when I first started to seclude myself off. It was not terrible but at the same time I had no real social connections. I did things like go on occasional outings with family members and such but I had no friends or social groups at all. Eventually I started to really dive into my playstation 2 and slowly started sticking there more and more as time went on. My grandparents both finally fell down ill due to old age. My grandmother developed parkinsons and my grandfather went through several bad falls as well as slowly developing dementia. This was an unbearably huge amount of stress on my mother who was already being torn apart by how hard she was struggling to keep the household up. Eventually she decided to sacrifice her job in exchange for taking up the home healthcare position of taking care of my grandparents. With this she would work literally next door to us, be able to take care of her parents when no one else in the family would, and she would still make an income. It was shaky but things were still fine back then. Around the age of 11 or so (bad memory of things back then) she decided to pay a heavy amount of money to put me back into school. There was a VERY small little private school in town that was run by an older gentleman named Mr. G, 3 teachers, and maybe a total student body of 25 or so children in various grades split between those 3. 2 of them were very nice older women named Miss D and then my teacher named Miss N,. I guess I had problems with anxiety but eventually I managed to be somewhat happy. Unfortunately the third teacher, Miss P who was the daughter of Miss D, was a very difficult person. She had extreme anger issues, seemed to just dislike children as a whole, and had absolutely no patience for anyone who lacked. Miss N was a much more Elderly woman than the other 2 and at some point she became far too ill to continue her teaching job. The remaining kids were mostly moved to Miss P's class with the only exceptions being the much younger children in the lower grades. Every single day was a living hell for me. The simplest way to describe it is that she held extreme animosity towards the weaker kids. If you were falling behind in the pace of your work, or if you were not producing grades that she was happy with, or if you did not understand something, she just hated you. When you did something like this she would threaten you, scream at you, talk to you like she was about to physically beat the shit out of you, oftentimes not so subtly threatening to actually do so. She used intimidation like standing directly above you in your seat and silently glaring you down. it would be even worse when she would bend down and put herself right in your face and start with her threatening. Or she would take a heavy book and slam it in front of you. There were at least 2 kids that definitely had learning problems, like a young little blonde boy named Tyler. The poor kid would often be the last to finish his work, or maybe it was even a group of 3 of us. she would slam her hand down on her desk in the corner, look at us like she was about to kill us, and then tell us in the most threatening manner that she could muster \"Get it down NOW\". The school had a physical discipline policy that was based on parental permission. she would often take Tyler somewhere to beat his ass with a belt when he was not performing like she wanted. The other method she used a lot was what I liken to a military \"shark attack\". she would take the student to a separate part of the school, plop them down in a chair, and start shouting in their face. She berated them on why they cannot do what she wants them to do, why they cannot do it fast enough, why cannot you understand this or that when you should be able to understand it, and when some poor kid can only respond with \"I do not know\" she just lays on harder. She always told us that we CAN do it how she wants but we are just lazy or do not want to do it. Or that our parents did not raise us properly.The principal, Mr G, apparently knew about some of this but Miss D did her best to protect her daughter. Some of the parents would become aware of this and many different students over the years would get taken out because they could not handle Miss P. Miss D was honestly a nice and good hearted person but I guess she simply loved her daughter and did not want to see her fired. I still do not know to this day how the school had not been hit with any legal problems but maybe what she was doing was not considered abuse or anything.Eventually history repeated itself and I continued to miss more and more school. I would wake up hours before it was time to leave for school because I was terrified of going and could not sleep. A lot of times I would cry on the way there and beg my mother to not force me to go. I think I had a hard time explaining to her why I hated school so much. She knew the teacher was causing issues but was not sure of what to do. Because she was soft she would let me skip school pretty often on days like that, but she was also pressed as she was paying the school a huge fee monthly for me to go, I was losing a lot of school work due to missing everything, and she was also legally pressed as there was a child law stating that you could not miss so many days of school. Finally after so long of it she mentally could not handle juggling my problematic school life and her other responsibilities so she pulled me out. I was labeled as being homeschooled so we were legally safe but I never touched a single bit of homeschooling work at all. Same situation as before. I had not managed to build any relationships with people and had no connections to social groups. I went back to my little room and continued to play video games. As the years went by I became more and more secluded and slowly degenerated as a person. Stopped interacting with even my family members, stopped leaving the house for days at a time, stopped interacting with my mother, stopped interacting with the house, ect. Then came things like neglecting my basic hygiene, neglecting my responsibility to assist with the household, ect. I am not worried about revealing this as I can remain anonymous but I believe my hygiene and standard of living was probably far below what most people could imagine. At the worst points of it I could have gone a month or over without bathing and years without brushing my teeth. My room had become a literal vile trash heap filled with soda cans, junk, dishes, and rotting food. How I never contracted some horrific disease is beyond me, and somehow I came out with a perfectly healthy set of teeth despite horrible yellowing. Through it all my mother destroyed herself trying to deal with me as a life sucking parasite living in the back of her house and her slowly dying parents that were succumbing to old age and terrible illnesses. I sat by staring at my computer screen, having basically no human interaction with anyone and even amongst online groups still being a weirdo that never got along with people, not paying attention to both her and the house falling apart. Even in my little computer world I was not satisfied though. I still do not understand a lot about myself but I believe I sought out video games as a form of fulfillment as I have nothing else. I looked towards competitive games or extremely grind heavy games as a way of feeling like I could accomplish something and feel like I had worth. Unfortunately I quickly learned that I was pretty mediocre at these things as well. Even if I could happily play a game 10, 12, 14 hours a day I still could not succeed how others could. I started to learn very quickly that regardless of what I dived into I was also lacking. I believe this led to my complex of believing that I am incapable of doing anything at all. Somewhere at around the age of 18 I got some awareness and finally realized where I would gone. Spent all of those years thinking \"No way I could end up like this. that is impossible.\" and then suddenly I open my eyes and I am already there. Seen my husk of a mother dealing with a dysfunctional family, both from her children and her siblings. Seeing everything I would loved as a child decayed and gone. I had a cousin named Jeff and his father named Sammy who I loved more than anyone else when I was a kid. When I was much younger Jeff died after a life fighting against cancer which left his father and mother broken. Instead of trying to connect with my uncle which could have done us both good I instead spent my time shutting myself off from my family, and eventually he also passed away from a broken heart and crippling illness. I cannot tell you how much I regret that. In 2017 my grandfather finally passed away from his problems, and then about 1 year later my grandmother followed after him. That was the end of my mothers employment and thus any income we had. Her mental state was destroyed by the years of stress and then the loss of her parents, and she was already in her 50's on top of being physically worn out so even if she wanted to try she was no longer fit for work. I was a pile of shit with mental issues who could not even interact with people properly anymore much less join the workforce. What little education I started out with had been completely forgotten and I forget how to even write. I can still write letters but there is almost no way I could handle anything past a few simple words. I only relearned how to write my name in cursive because I had to start filling out my own paperwork in hospitals and such. I never actually remembered or possibly even learned how to use proper grammar and punctuation. What I am doing now is only from me copying what I see other people do and trying to figure out how it is used from there. I have tried self learning things in the past but I get overwhelmed and it feels like I cannot grasp anything no matter what I try. We spent the next several years in financial hell. Begging friends and family for money where we can just to keep utilities and internet on, of course using government programs for things like food stamps. There were plenty of times where we would lose electricity or water anyway as there is a limit to begging and what others can do to help you when they are struggling with their own lives. Our relatives in Texas were a bit more successful and it was in large part thanks to them that we even managed at some points. Even still we have had situations where we lived without water for months before, electricity for weeks, ect. We also managed to rack up a utility debt to the town which is where we would lose the water a lot. It was due to an error on their part where they failed to shut off our gas line and thus charged us for utilities we did not use. We were constantly hit by struggle after struggle but life continued on. Somewhere along the way I developed a back disability. It could have been hereditary, it could have been a random occurrence, or it could have been a result of my terrible lifestyle. I do not know the answer. At first it was not anything major but it slowly progressed to be worse and worse as time went on. After so long we started to piece things back together through a few different methods. Specifically we relied on a deposit that originally belonged to my grandparents but my family handed it over to us since we needed money the most. Then my grandfather's precious car that had decayed away in his garage was also sold. This money at least helped us for a few months until we finally managed to get more government assistance and deal with the town. We managed to get a program that pays for our electricity and then got the town to ignore the debt of our water bill for the time being while we pay a small amount every month to keep it on. Eventually though I started to crack. Over the years I refused to swallow the notion of depression. I had lived my entire life by having my mother take care of me, sacrificing herself to deal with me even though she should not have. I had not changed my ways much but I started to develop a mentality that I did not deserve anything from anyone, especially not the right to be depressed. I would have moments where it would creep up on me, but I would throw it away and ignore it. However time went on and the guilt only piled up. I could not change my ways or do anything to change my life. I am nothing but a burden and I cannot change it. The fact that I would always revert back to my ways and the fact that years went by without any sort of change killed me so much. Then one day about a year ago I watched a motivational video from an old man who started from a truly low position in life. He was a bright and strong old guy who tried to convince the younger generation that they can do it and that he understands that life is hard for people in these times, maybe even harder than it was in his. I watched a few of his videos and the only thing I could think was \"I am nothing like this person. I cannot be as strong as this person. I cannot change my life like this person. I am sorry for failing.\". that is when I first started hurting myself. was not anything major. Was an old pocket knife and I did not aim deep. And you know? It felt good. Not in a physical way of course. I would been taking so many painkiller/muscle relaxer pills that I did not feel much. However I would always thought that I could not even commit suicide if I wanted to because I would be too weak to even endure the pain or have the guts enough to because it. But those few cuts proved me wrong. I could do it and it was pretty easy, and that made me happy. For about a week I would continue making cuts here and there just to continue reaffirming that feeling of accomplishment. I just passed the cuts off as my huge cat losing his marbles and attacking my arm. Since I would never really interacted with my mother much and never allowed myself to show any sort of symptoms of depression she did not even begin to suspect anything else. But then an argument happened. It was something stupidly simple. I had a pack of meat that I wanted to take out of the freezer to defrost, but it was 2 separate packs joined in the middle by tough plastic. I could not separate it and lazily threw the entire thing into the fridge to defrost. My mother stopped me and proceeded to lecture me about how I always waste so much food and I got annoyed. I just grabbed the meat and was going to chuck it back into the freezer for another time but then she got pissed at that as well and jerked it out from in front of me and started telling me how I am always so childish, impatient, lazy, and \"I am beginning to think that you will never change\". This one little line broke something. I thought to myself \"She also understands that I am worthless and that I will never change or become better\". It was like I knew that she knew the entire time but hearing it and thus confirming it is an entirely different thing for me. Even though I of course knew that is not what she meant I could not help but think about these things. I quietly slinked off into my room like I normally do but once I was behind a closed door and was not being bothered I silently broke down. I cried, I laughed at myself, and then I started cutting more. This time was harder. I was angry at myself with how fucking pathetic and disgusting and how much of a soul sucking worm I was. After a few larger cuts than normal I really broke down and finally started going for real deep wounds.Then I looked out of the corner of my eye and noticed an old fish fillet knife on my desk. I enjoy knives as a hobby so I had a lot of different stuff scattered around my room. I took it, thought about what sort of damage I could deal with it, and I was happy at the thought. To avoid explicit details I ended up with 4 deep gashes. I was not sure if I was necessarily thinking of committing suicide with that or not. I almost wanted it but I also avoided cutting directly on the wrist and also remained aware the entire time that I knew a better method to ensure it would work if I committed to it. I did not feel much of anything, maybe not even the slightest burn. could have been adrenaline, could have been the pain meds, could have been both. However as I sat there for a while breaking down further and further while I continued to bleed badly the thought crossed my mind that I could have actually done potentially fatal damage. I never really had a plan to begin with for hiding such massive cuts but they were far beyond the point of just wrapping them up and pretending it was nothing. that is when my legs gave out, my vision blurred, I became ultra light headed, and my arms and hands became extremely numb while tingling super hard. Id suddenly got scared and thought that I might have killed myself somehow. I stumbled to the front of the house and showed my mother what happened. Told her I loved her and was sorry for failing her and then just sat down on the kitchen floor and just kind of blurred out from there. A nearby off duty EMT rushed over and took a look. Nothing fatal as the knife had been dulled over the years without me knowing but stitches were definitely needed so she patched me up as best as she could and I was rushed to a hospital in a far off city. Closest city could not accept me due to covid or something so I ended up going to a larger but further away city. Mother cried so much on the way there and she was absolutely traumatized. Ended up saying goodbye to her at the hospital entrance and then sat in a holding cell for what was probably about 3-4 hours. Went through the process of getting patched up and once day break hit I got shipped off to a mental facility nearby. I spent about a week there. I had more human interaction in that 1 week than I had in the entire 10 years leading up to that point, and most of it was me silently sitting in the corner. Despite that though the facility was not worth anything at all and I am still not sure how people are cured there. Maybe it was a holding facility and not an actual hospital but I do not know and never cared to know. It was just a depressing common room where everyone just sat around in uncomfortable chairs, drank decaffeinated coffee, and tried their best to sleep through the day until they were allowed to go back to their rooms for the night. Met some interesting characters. The people in there ranged from people with major disorders, to people in drug remission, people coming off an alcohol trip, and even something like anger problems. Got to meet a gorgeous young hood girl named Audrey who I instantly developed a crush on and also got to experience what it was like having a roommate even if I absolutely hated it. Was picked up by my mother and uncle after my week was up and really had not received any sort of help or counseling. Id felt like an entirely different person though just finally being around people and even briefly opening up about myself to a few people around me. Had some sort of psychiatrist call center try to help me afterwards but all it amounted to was a group of random people who I formed no connection to calling me up whenever they felt like it to ask me if I was ok and if I needed any more meds. I was probably at fault since Id already had a hard time opening up but I felt even less inclined when it was someone I did not care about or know over the phone. Suddenly for a short bit I had family members swarming around and feeling like they had to somehow help me. Was given my first cellphone as I had not ever needed nor wanted one previously, and not but maybe a few weeks later my cousin contacted me to tell me he wanted me to work a part time job. Its really low hours which works in my favor with my disability and its a simple cleaning job so I can pick it up so easily. I thought of this as a first step that would hopefully give me a mentality that I can do better and I can be of use to people. The money is next to nothing but for the first time in years we do not have to ask someone for assistance the moment we need even the smallest of things. Can keep basic household items around, keep my pets fed, try to keep bills paid, ect. After about 2 or so months I turned towards fixing my back. If my legs recover from the severe muscle pains I experience when walking then I could hold a full time job with good pay and from there its just a slow process of building myself up. The ineptitude I feel, the lack of education that haunts me, the disability that holds me back, all of it could be fixed with some time. I felt so happy and it was such a new feeling that I had not felt in so long. that is when everything quickly came caving in. So far my doctors and related medical procedures were all moving at a crawl. I spent several years dealing with a doctor that had to be demanded to move through several visits before they would actually do something, and I repeatedly kept getting thrown back and forth between tests and random crap. I ended up in physical therapy several times but that never amounted to much because apparently government health insurance does not afford particularly quality or motivated therapy sessions. That went nowhere fast and so Id spent the years up until that point just hopped up on a high dose of painkiller/muscle relaxers. However all of a sudden everything sped up real damn quick. There was immediate discussion about consulting a neurosurgeon which we spent a while trying to find due to not only the limitations on what the state had available but also what we could find with our insurance. Dumb doctor seemed optimistic and told me it should be easily treatable. Finally got to meet my neurosurgeon for the first time and he was even more optimistic. He spun a tale of how so damn easy and quick it would be to fix a busted disc and that even if the back pain was not 100% cured there was no way he could not fix it up so that my legs were not fine again. Said everything was a guaranteed easy operation. So on my very first consultation due to my naivety and stupidly thinking I could trust doctors I agreed to a surgery. Short version of that is several shady things happened with that doctor and after about a month or 2 of recovery I could safely say that not only had the surgery failed but I was not at least 2 or 3 times worse off than I was previously. Now that were later into 2021 I have been told after a follow up visit that the disc is no longer salvageable and the damage may yet get worse as there are signs that more discs will degrade and blow out in the future. A surgery to potentially stop the problem from worsening has been suggested but all of his previous enthusiasm is gone and he believes there is a good chance the rest of my discs will go bad regardless of what happens. For now I am taking more pain meds than before just trying to keep my little job together but who knows when that will start to fail as well. In that time span of my cutting incident to now I rose up higher than Id been in years only to fall lower than Id ever been before mentally. Things like my hygiene have gotten to acceptable levels. I still have anxiety about so many things that eat away at me on a daily basis but I have gotten better at talking to people even if I cannot manage to build social connections. But I have completely lost hope of ever escaping poverty, ever having a body that is not too weak to do what I want, trying to build a normal social life and make up for all those years I wasted, or even escaping from behind my little computer screen. Any time I try to think about it, or when someone tells me what I should be doing, somewhere along in that plan that I am cooking up I reach a roadblock that stems from something of these 3 issues. I have come to hate everything about myself and where I am at now. Even if I try to explain it away I still blame myself for ending up like this. Suicide seems to be the only thing I can think about now as I have lost all form of motivation to even do the things that I once enjoyed. I am simply trying to pass through each day until hopefully I hit another emotional breakdown that will give me the push I want to overcome everything else and just end it. Rather than wasting my time and spending my entire life self loathing and living like this I decided that if nothing changes by the time I am 25 in 2 more years Ill resolve myself to end it if I do not do it sooner. Venting and dumping my story here if that is fine. it is ok if it needs to be removed for whatever reason.）：UNAUTHORIZED USER\n",

      "\n",
      "I've been working a relatively stressful job for the last four years. The stress was manageable until about a year ago when I was given the responsibility of managing a global team of systems administrators in the US, Hungary and India that all work to give 24/7 coverage to my company. I can't go into specifics of our work, but I can say that we are an extremely important team. There are a lot of reasons behind why I have become increasingly stressed out, the main one being that I have personally been the only point of failure for the whole thing for almost the entire year. I can't take a day off, or sometimes even an hour off without someone from like 14 time zones away trying to escalate something to me, or my boss of they can't reach me directly. Before this past week, I had taken one scheduled day off, and I still got a call from my boss asking to get people online for an outage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me say, my boss is amazing. She is the best example of leadership I've ever had in any job, and I've worked IT for like 25 years. She just has a very demanding job role also, and I am in a spot where I'm kind of working 4-5 different full time job roles, and one of those job roles requires that I get people online for outages which are not at all related to the global team I'm responsible for. \n",
      "\n",
      "The past few months, people have increasingly seen that I'm getting more and more stressed to the point where I had a chat with HR because I had started working like 75+ hour weeks sometimes until 2am. I basically said that \"because of how I've been forced to set this whole team up within the guidelines I'm given by upper management (not my direct boss), nobody else has time to work this project, so if I don't do the work myself, it can't get done.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I mean, everyone saw it coming including me. Then last week happened. I was supposed to have Friday off as a normal day because leadership rotates Sundays for the other full time job role apart from the project, so every time I work a Sunday, I get the following Friday off. We had a major issue happen on Thursday which we knew would carry into this coming weekend, so I was going to cancel both my Friday off and the planned time I had on the calendar for like three months from Wednesday - Sunday this week because I knew everything would get messed up if I didn't. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I decided, this was a chance for me to test if other parts of leadership can actually do their jobs. Instead of canceling my time off like I have literally every other time something like this has happened the last year, I decided to take it. However, I gave my peers the plan of what needed to happen from Friday - Sunday, laid out for them completely, and all but spoonfed them. I went into it trying to just expect people to do their jobs. All they had to do was say \"Ok, we have the plan, here's this person who can do this thing that needs to get done, I'll have them do it...\" I also knew it wasn't going to happen like that. I knew... I knew that come Sunday evening, nothing would get done. So, I went Friday without checking my work phone. I went Saturday without checking my work phone. Then Sunday rolled around, and I finally checked... sure enough, even though my peers had the plan, it wasn't executed. I had to log in on Sunday to quickly get the right weekend people on it, and because things weren't executed on time during Friday/Saturday like I said they needed to be, it caused two huge outages like twelve time zones away. \n",
      "\n",
      "I went into work on Monday morning completely distraught. I met with my directs under me basically telling them that what happened is not their fault, and an effect of ineffective leadership which I'm largely responsible for. I sat there for a good 45 minutes apologizing to them, telling them what I plan to do going forward, and also commiserating because I was really as stressed as they were about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "During that talk, something broke in me, I think. Like, I had known that I was the sole failure point globally, but I was fine with that as long as I had people who could simply just organize whatever plan I gave them. I gave them that plan on Thursday, trying to clear things off my plate as I have been advised to do by my boss and HR, just expecting them to do basically the bare minimum, and they weren't capable of executing. I finally actually felt the full weight of being the sole failure point of global operations, and it crushed down on me so hard that I could barely breathe. \n",
      "\n",
      "I went to my boss after that meeting, and told her I had to leave for the day, but I would be back the next day. I took Monday off, almost too full of anxiety to even drive home, but made it then just watched movies I'd seen a hundred times already all day because I couldn't process any new information. I felt alright though, like at the end of it I had a sense of purpose, and renewed motivation. I woke up Tuesday completely ready to rock it at work, but as soon as I pulled out of the parking lot, I started to get a feeling I've only ever felt once before. I hopped on the highway, and the closer I got to work, the more I felt it. Then, it happened. I had a panic attack. I had to pull off the highway to turn around to go home. The second I had my car going back the other way, I felt like I could breathe even though I was still having heart palpitations, tunnel vision, numb tongue, etc. I got home, called my boss, and was straight up with her stating I had a panic attack on my way in, and I would not be making it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then came yesterday. I had to make a five hour drive back to my hometown for the plans I had made for the aforementioned scheduled time off. I was happy, looking forward to it, couldn't wait to get back, but as soon as I got on the highway, the dread set in. The obsessive thoughts set in. I spent the next five hours in panic attack mode to the point where I don't know how I actually drove the car. All I wanted to do was get home, so I kept going, but I stopped like six times to re-center myself on a trip that I don't generally even stop on once.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got here, took a breath, sat down for a bit, and things were okay. But ever since, it's been a mixed bag of being okay for a while, then like 30-60 minutes of panic attack... then being okay again, then another panic attack. Thankfully, I spent today playing golf with my family which is what I had been looking so forward to, but it took like an hour for me to come into reality when we first started out. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then I got back, took a nap, and woke up in a panic attack about an hour later. \n",
      "\n",
      "Like, this is not at all my natural state. I am normally a very chill person who handles stress immensely well. I have had one panic attack before during a very difficult time, but I've never had multiples of them, and I've most certainly never had a nervous breakdown... but I think that's where I am. I've tried talking to my family, but none of them really understand because none of them has ever really had this kind of breakdown. General depression, anxiety, and that stuff, so they can relate (haha, family can relate...) on that level, but it's like I can barely be a functioning human. That's what they can't relate with. \n",
      "\n",
      "That's why I decided to post here hoping that someone else can relate, and just let me know this is going to end at some point. I'm not suicidal, or anything, I'll suffer through whatever I have to suffer though, I just need to have a light at the end of the tunnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you ever seen Se7en? You know that part where they find the guy Kevin Spacey had been keeping alive for a year, and the doctor said \"If I were to shine a light in his eyes right now, he'd die of the stress...\"? That's where I feel like I am. Like any source of any stress from anywhere that raises my adrenaline whatsoever just throws me into a panic attack. I am trying to deal, but it's difficult feeling like there's no end in sight because I've never experienced this before so I don't know what to expect. \n",

So I’m happy in the city I live in , but I’m not happy with the circumstances of the last two years and instead of looking back I’m trying to look forward and realize my lie isn’t over and boring and useless. First off I used to go the gym and run and eat healthy, and I was in much better shape  obviously. Than Covid came my work hours changed and so did my diet along with everything else. I work retail so those who work it or have will know exactly what I’m talking about. So in 2022 I tried to restart by going back to being a vegetarian, forcing myself to go back to the gym etc, but my motivation is just not there yet . I do have a small social life so I’m thankful for that and I am also a photographer as I love all the architecture in this city . But I need more friends my age I’m\n",
      "Guessing and there just seem to be no women who aren’t partiers or who would let me be myself with them . Or maybe I’m looked at as asexual or unattractive. Anyways I just need something more exciting than just work and home . I wish I had a group o could do things with but of course my schedule makes it tough .\n",
      "\n",
      "My dating/sex history:\n",
      "I was never very good at asking women out even though most of my life I was told I was extremely handsome I’m tall 6”1 blonde hair , brown eyes . I was told I could have modeled when I was younger . Anyway I didn’t lose my virginity till I was 20 which is late but partly because i was shy , just not confident. I had an opportunity to be that girls boyfriend who I lost my virginity to but I just decided I didn’t want a relationship with her , well between 2007 and 2009 I had no heterosexual sex but desired it but was insecure, etc . I’ll admit because I grew up in San Francisco and had gay friends I even experimented with gay men as a way out since I was just not having relationships with women but I realized obviously I was not gay or bi since I didn’t feel attracted to men . Than I’m 2010 I had sex with a drunk cougar and that was one and done . I had a disasterous date with a woman in the mission district in sf and it was horrible. I than tried going to “ cougar bars” with my friend but of course we would never go home with anyone, and it wasn’t my scene anyway. Than in 2012 I met my first girlfriend who was older than me at a class. Funny thing is I liked her immediately and she clearly liked me . We saw the Batman dark knight movie which was our first date in 2012. Well we fucked like crazy so much so that I felt it was a bit much and the non sexual side of our relationship seemed kinda ehhh….\n",
      "Well I eventually drove her away and regretted it . And since then I’ve slept with a few older women from 2015-2019. But since Covid I’ve had no sex except masturbation . Partly I still do struggle with being insecure and feeling like Women will never be into me which I know is nonsense of course . But I am now have a strange sense of being torn on one hand I would like to be in a relationship, on the other hand my life is busy enough with work and exploring stuff in LA with my camera . I almost feel like the woman would have to be perfect for me because I feel like maybe my earlier history told me something that I’m just someone who lost their virginity late and because of it maybe it messed me up or maybe I’m better off just with a few friends and my own life . Partly I think I need someone who I can be myself around them without judgment and I’m trying to change . Maybe I’m just to weird or absent minded . I try to work on my confidence and I try to\n",
      "Fake it till I make it but that can only last so long . I do have confidence issues and while I’m secretive about it deep inside I feel like most women are either judging me or think I’m unattractive , or that I’m gay. \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess I need to work on myself . I want to get back into shape , eat healthier, exercise like I used to . Also I use to shave everyday clean shaven and short hair but when Covid came I got lazy. I’m going to try and get myself together and work on myself. I take my medication for depression which helps and I do have a therapist but I can’t see her as much as I’d like . I do have challenges but I always try to work through them \n",
      "\n",
      "My issues with sex, relationships, asking women out :\n",
      "I have often had issues with asking women out , etc. it’s weird maybe I am incel yet I don’t blame my problems on women I blame it all on myself that I’m my own worst enemy. I tend to shoot myself in the foot . It’s weird because I don’t consider myself repressed. I grew up in a liberal household in San Francisco. I also am not a right winger as most incels are . I am liberal . Anyways so most men can ask a woman out with no problem and nothing would faze them . I on the other hand have trouble because I don’t want to make a fool of myself, come off as creepy etc . Good example is there is this customer at work who I like and comes in most everyday . Her and I talk quite a bit when I’m helping her and we smile at each other . And I think she likes me , but probably just being friendly. Two of my colleagues know I like her and always ask “ Have you asked her out yet “ I always give an excuse or that she wouldn’t want to have anything to do with me that way.  So other guys could just ask a woman out with no issue but not me. Also I’m not at my best right now and want to get back to being healthy and exercise. The funny thing is I can talk to beautiful women because I do every day because I work in Beverly Hills and I can engage and be friendly but on my own I don’t seek out to talk to women because of my own fear as how they view me. The funny thing is I did ask my ex gf out but it wasn’t really a “date asking her out it was more casual and things developed. I just wonder if I can overcome these issues that have been plaguing me for a good chunk of my life . I just sometimes feel I’m cursed .h）：UNAUTHORIZED USER\n",

      "I think I know now why I need depressive phases.\n",
      "By saying that, I don't mean the physical side of depression. This implies fatigue, general exhaustion, increased or decreased need for sleep, the same applies to appetite, drop in libido, decrease in hygiene and general activities. The body needs to recover. It takes time.\n",
      "What I am talking about is the emotional, intellectual, — if you want — spiritual side of depression. I think I found a purpose of depression on the other side of the coin.\n",
      "It appears that I grow during these times, because I reflect a lot on the recent events, critically evaluate my actions and decisions, as well as my reasoning behind them. Most importantly, I try to understand my mistakes and to learn lessons from them so that I will never repeat them again.\n",
      "In all fairness, it is a painful and self-destructive process. Most of the time, it is counterproductive and worsens the state of an affected person with ever increasing speed. It is a vicious circle of being paralyzed, feeling ashamed of it and guilty for own disengagement, inability to find enough energy to at least do things that you generally like (normally, it’s worse: you completely lost interest in the things you like), being paralyzed from shame and guilt, hating yourself for this lameness, becoming ever more disgusted by your own bad smell and a total disaster on the floor and in the kitchen, feeling dizzy and weak at all times, having a hurting back and ass cheeks from spending days in bed, losing all respect for yourself and hope for improvement, wanting to give up and to end the pain.\n",
      "You are a burden. You are a disgrace. You are worthless. You have no purpose. Your existence does not make any sense. You are a waste of resources. You are a disappointment. Your parents must be ashamed of you. They should regret bringing you to the world. You will never produce anything meaningful. You will never change anything. You mean nothing. You are a lab rat in the obstacle race in an endless labyrinth. You were born a slave to the indifferent capitalist feudalistic world system. You will never find your place in the society. All spots are occupied. Even the untouchable ones. But you are nothing special. You don’t even have the guts to slip down the social ladder and join the untouchables in protest against the system. “Fuck the system” remains just a graffiti on the platform of a subway station. You are a fucking joke.\n",
      "This is an approximation of the thinking patterns typical of a depressive episode. They dance in circles in your head, every day. They hold hands and take turns in solo parts. They exhaust you. You wake up with them and you go to sleep with them. You cry when you fall asleep. You cry when you wake up. Day after day.\n",
      "Slowly you develop a real anxiety for answering phone calls. They terrify you. People want something from you. We don’t want that. Opening the mail box becomes a real nightmare. You spend days pursuaiding yourself to open your mail account or to open your post box. You stop answering text messages. You are tired of lying that you are doing fine. You are not fine.\n",
      "During the depression, I take a pause of silence. I cut my connections to the outer world and go inside myself. I need that time free of background noises and external advice to keep hearing my thoughts. This is the time when I re-evaluate my knowledge and values. Regarding this, three semi-cool metaphors come to my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Winter tree\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression looks like a tree in a night of winter sleep. That very deep and dreamless slumber. Though, how would we know? They might as well watch nightmares, which could compete with the Saw, or I spit on your grave. It is sad and does not bring joy to anyone. To some, it might even look ugly. Sometimes, decomposing fall foliage that cover the decaying human and animal feces with a soft fluffy coat smell bad. I mean, really bad. You better keep on moving.\n",
      "The tree stops interacting with the surrounding life. Birds abandoned their nests and no longer sing on its branches. It lost all its leaves and stays alone for the rest of the winter. It might appear that it is cold or dead. It is winter that makes its skin harden and darken. It becomes raw and thick.\n",
      "Or we could look at it differently. Winter can be beautiful. I love winter. It is my favorite season. In Germany, winter is usually gray and wet. The wind is brutal, you don’t want to go outside. The gray sky weighs heavy on your head. You are cold.\n",
      "On those days, I often must think of winter in Russia. With a nostalgic smile and a sharp wrench in my heart, I see my way home, my parents’ house, a rare artifact of Russian wooden architecture that survived the Revolution of 1917, on a peaceful winter night. The sky was beautifully painted in the darkest and deepest blue. Twinkling stars were magically winking at me. The way home from the bus stop was a thin stamp white trail in the snow. It lied between two snowbanks, as high as your knees. Tiny snow flakies sparkled in the soft orange light of the lanterns along the road. Like in a slow motion, the snow was falling on my palms and in my mouth in huge fluffy flakies. It was Christmas magic. No vehicles were driving by. It was so silent, that the only sound that sent waves into the space was crispy and squeaky snow under my heavy winter boots. I was the happiest I could be. \n",
      "Inevitably, the spring comes. And the tree that was asleep just yesterday, wakes up and gets more beautiful than ever. It gives birth to fresh crispy-green leaves, it grows more branches which are strong and flexible. The new ones make the tree bigger and older.\n",
      "It hosts more nests and attracts more birds to sing on its branches in the early morning when the sun rises. It amazes more people, they enjoy being around the tree. People go outside and spend time in its shadow. They arrange pick-nicks under its thick coat of leaves, laugh, eat and take pictures. More animals and kids play on the tree’s branches. Some might even build a small cabin on them, which will become a young kid’s secret escape into the magical world of their dreams.\n",
      "In Russia, they have a tradition of hugging a tree. It is believed that the tree would suck up all of the negativity and charge you with positive energy. Many people even have their special tree, which suits their personality. Some prefer the pine tree, others the oak tree. Lime trees and birches are popular as well.\n",
      "Then the fall approaches. The facade starts cracking, the leaves are falling off. Everything is getting browner and rainier. Slowly, everyone left the tree behind. Birds headed off south to have a sex-vacation, people are running from box to box hiding under an umbrella. It's winter again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current view from from kitchen\n",
      "Last spring, I had a crazy idea that I can be an artist. So in a creative madness I decorated the only tree in our backyard with pieces of my old linen. And then died it with acrylic paint. I conceptualized it as a memory tree. Because my linen kept memories of nearly everything and outlived a lot of relationships and tragedies. Now, my roommate says, it is the only thing that reminds him of joy in the whole backyard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Computer game\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression is like a progressing computer game. You need to die so many times until you learn the lesson and get to the next level.\n",
      "Sometimes, when the level is hard, it gets frustrating and exhausting at some point. You lose interest and give up on the game. And when you do that, you stop playing the game and stop unlocking the next levels. That's a metaphor of the suicide.\n",
      "Suicide is the worst possible side-effect of mental illnesses. It should rightfully be taken seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Real suicide\n",
      "\n",
      "Last summer, a fellow member from the self-help group, which I regularly visit, jumped off a roof. She left two kids behind. She was young and had a special outlook on the world, which she lived in photography. She had been deeply depressed since March, when I saw her for the first time, which was the first time I visited a group meeting.\n",
      "In the flash round, she cried. She said, she could not bear it anymore, that she just wanted to give up. I felt that. I felt her pain. I knew too well those two sentences. There comes a time when only those two are left. And you just cry and say them over and over again. I wanted to give her a warm hug and to let her cry on my shoulder. But we didn't know each other. So, I had to restrain.\n",
      "At the end of May, she committed suicide. It shook deeply the whole group. It became so apparent that this is how the game ends for us. Many of us were deeply grieving.\n",
      "Up to 17% of people with bipolar disorder will take their lives as a result of their illness, making it the #1 cause of premature death in people with this disorder. Women attempt suicide about 3 times more often than men, although men are 4 times as likely to complete suicide. People with bipolar disorder are 2x more likely to attempt suicide than someone with a unipolar disorder. In a review of deaths of individuals with bipolar disorder from 1936-1988, 19% of 9,389 deaths were found to be because of suicide. (Ctrl+C Ctrl+V from the listing40 Profound Bipolar Disorder Suicide Statistics. Source: HealthResearchFunding.org)\n",
      "At her funeral on July 3rd, I was brokenhearted. I was late because it had taken me quite a time to choose the right black shirt and trousers. Dresses seemed too festive to me. I was nervous, it was my first funeral in Germany. It was my first suicide funeral. It was my first mental health funeral.\n",
      "The chapel was crowded. I stood leaning on the cold wooden door. I breathed heavily and needed time to process. I had never seen so many people attending a funeral. Those are small and private in Russia unless you are some kind of famous or rich. I counted some 250 people. All grieving. Some crying.\n",
      "Speeches were boring and long. Also, swampy and sticky. I was outraged when the priest said, \"We cannot know why [she] left. It will remain a mystery forever.\" I wanted to scream. I wanted to scream so loud so that he would stop talking. How dare you say that we don't know why she jumped off the roof? How dare you indifferently pass the verdict that it will remain a mystery? I wanted to scream. Or to leave the chapel and slam the door.\n",
      "But I couldn't leave. I needed to stay. I owed it to her. I started crying. I couldn't stop. Tears ran in deep rivers down my cheeks. I didn't have a napkin. I couldn't bear the ceremony, but I couldn't go either.\n",
      "In the chapel across the columns, her family hung out on a string her photographs for the visitors to take away as a memory of her. I waited for most people to take one and leave the chapel. By the time I came up to the string with hanging photographs, I only had three left to choose from. I picked a very bleak image of a closed backyard, probably taken from a balcony on some fourth floor, on a clouded winter day. It was bleak. Like depression that kills us. I took it to remember this.\n",
      "The weather outside was good and sunny. It seemed totally out of place in the given context. The sun brutally burned my shoulders in the black shirt. I hate the sun. I hate everything when there is the sun. It blinds me, makes me sweaty and hot, and gives me headaches. Also, it burns my skin. So, no reason to love it. As I stood in line to throw my flower into the grave, I spent my time hating the sun. In that moment, I didn't realize how much this day would impact me. Her name was Verena.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depression\n",
      "\n",
      "Directly after the funeral, I fell into the deepest, darkest and the coldest well of depression. None of the previous episodes could come close to this one in severity. I was tired, I was failing on all fronts. I had ten days left to write my master's thesis, after which I had to go to Russia for three weeks — I deserved a vacation. I had been in a manic phase when I invited my then-partner's mom to come to visit Russia with me. Also, I didn't know how I was going to pay my bills. Verena's death was the trigger.\n",
      "When it became clear that I would not be able to finish my thesis before the deadline and that I needed an extension, it was too late to cancel the trip. Christoph's (my ex) mom had already made all the reservations. I didn't want to go there. I had a bad feeling. I wanted to stay home and close off myself from the angry, cruel world. But I rarely change plans. So, I went.\n",
      "I arrived in Moscow already at my worst. The first thing that I did upon arrival was buying a battery of alcoholic beverages and red bull cans to keep me going. This way I was going to write my thesis and to finish it by August 3rd. Good plan, destined for success.\n",
      "I worked, but much more I drank, smoked and had severe headaches. A bad state to write your thesis. My next step was to keep myself awake by the cocktail vodka red bull, with a lot of vodka and a lot of red bull. Three all-nighters, four cigarette packs. I came forward. But the body never forgives.\n",
      "Then Christoph's mother came. For a whole week, I needed to guide, to entertain and to translate for her. She was nearly helpless without me. She didn't know the language, people often didn't speak English and she wasn't very well at that either. Most importantly, she couldn't plan her program by herself. And she needed company by nearly any activity she undertook. A rich touristic program requires to get up early and to go to bed late. I was getting exhausted. I gave out all my energy, even the emergency generator. Burned all calories. No spoons left.\n",
      "I still needed to finish my thesis. So again all-nighters, again red bull. With the only difference: I increasingly preferred watching TV shows over writing the thesis. And I couldn't wake up. I turned into a horrible host and an indifferent individual. I could not wait for her to leave. A shameful thought, but I could not ban it from my thinking feed. I was anticipating my trip to Saint Petersburg, the time in a summery St. Petersburg, which everyone is talking about. I wanted to fall in love with St. Petersburg too. I was excited to see Sonya, my dear friend-by-coincidence. She is an architecture enthusiast and gives brilliant city tours.\n",
      "Instead, I locked myself up in her room for the whole week of my stay. I only came out of the room to either visit the bathroom or smoke a cigarette. Much more seldom it was because of the food. I was starving. Worse, I was deadly afraid to go outside. I was afraid of people and public space. I went outside only to buy cigarettes or alcohol, only at night and only in Sonya's company.\n",
      "What was I doing behind the closed doors the whole week? I was watching a TV show. Over and over again. Until I exhaust myself and pass out. Sometimes Sonya forced me to work on my thesis, and I did. But more often I watched TV series, not wrote my thesis. In this fashion, I spent my last week before the deadline.\n",
      "I failed. Self-explanatory. I went to my psychiatrist and first thing cried a quarter hour. I was the worst failure in the history of failures. He gave me a sick leave until the end of October. I had time to crawl out of the deep stinky rabbit hole I had accidentally fallen into. \n",
      "\n",
      "_____________\n",
      "So back to the pink fluffy unicorns: I, for example, like to play Two Dots. It's an endless game which gets ever more complicated. Being depressed I spent hours solving new problems and trying to unlock a new level. Eventually, I would give up and even delete the app from my phone. But then occasionally, I would install it again and start it all over. Because deleting the app did not kill the small worm who wants salvation from unresolved problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lighthouse stairs\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, depression is like a brief stop on the endless stairs leading to the top of a lighthouse. You take upon this torture because of the view that it rewards you with in the end. The way up there is at times unbearable and brutal to your lungs and leg muscles. The space is tight, and the air is bad.\n",
      "Normally, the stairs are also crowded af, if we take a tower in a city hall or a cathedral. So, taking a short breath break is like a lottery. When you do get a chance, you would bow putting your hands on your knees. You breathe heavily and your face is red. You get no air, your lungs hurt, your leg muscles are sore. Looking either up or down makes you dizzy, and your feet sweat with tiny ice-cold drops.\n",
      "In that moment you question your sanity in deciding to punish yourself with these stairs. You now see the promised view in relation to your suffering. You re-evaluate the price- performance ratio. And the results are not in favor of the view. But the stream of people on the stairs keeps moving. In most cases, it carries you away, again and again upwards.\n",
      "Maybe the saddest thing about this is that in most cases you barely spend ten minutes on the roof of the tower. You briefly enjoy the view. Sometimes the view is disappointing. The weather was bad, gray clouds covered the city with a thick ceiling. The wind was strong and freezing. Your hair was flying around and got in your eyes and your mouth. It might be dirty and noisy upstairs. Even better, if you are afraid of height. In most cases, it's pretty crowdy on top. People are pushing each other, trying to get the best view. No one is talking to each other.\n",
      "It is understandably very upsetting. You take pictures from all possible angles anyways and go downstairs. The way down seems much shorter than the way up. You easily run downstairs asking yourself whether the view was worth the trouble. You don't know.\n",
      "Sometimes though, you might give up halfway through and turn back. Similar to the computer game wormy, we have a tower wormy. Every once in a while, it bites a little bit off your achievement organ and crawls inside your thinking organ. Then you forget about it only to remember again sometime later.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, going back to my introduction, when I wrote that during the depression, I try to understand my mistakes and to learn lessons from them so that I will never repeat them again.\n",
      "In manic phases, which in my case normally follow depressive episodes, I challenge myself to act upon my new knowledge and imperatives. I need to do that to prove myself that I learned the lesson and deserve redemption.\n",
      "I am my strongest critic. I need to forgive myself to move on, not the forgiveness of the others. I pass my own judgment on my actions. Because I know best all my motifs and thoughts. And before I ultimately forgive myself, I ask for forgiveness people that I hurt. Not formally to check the box, but genuinely and humbly.\n",
      "NB! I did not intend to romanticize depression with these metaphors, or worse, to implicate that I have the cure to depression. Depression is a serious, brutal disease that tragically changes people's lives, and sometimes ends them. Therefore, I do not recommend terminating your prescription meds, if you are affected by depression or other mental health issues. I take a bunch of those on a daily basis. However, I do not propagate for taking medication either. Whatever works for you best is best for your health. Invest time into exploring those ways. It always pays off.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are affected by depression\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are affected by depression, allow yourself time to recover. My former therapist used to say: \"If you want to lie on the couch, lie on the couch\". That's the best advice I can give you. When you are well, you won't lie on the couch anyways. Take your time. There is no hurry when it comes to health.\n",
      "Second advice is to start slow and small. Make your bed. It's challenging enough. Don't be ashamed of feeling like taking a shower or doing laundry (because you have nothing left to wear) is Mount Everest (or Mount Weather rofl). It's okay. All people with depression share this mess and this shame. I think we should talk about this more, to support each other. So again, start small. Make your bed. It's enough.\n",
      "Third thing, your depression procrastination pays off. Hundreds if not thousands of hours that I spent on YouTube watching beauty tutorials, BuzzFeed videos and in-depth analyses of each Game of Thrones’ episode, eventually make up for the wasted time. At some point, you'll be able to connect the dots and turn that Netflix binge madness into something meaningful.\n",
      "Lastly, if you have suicidal thoughts, get help immediately. Tell people about this. Tell them\n",
      "how you feel. Don’t be silent. They care. Get any help that’s available and acceptable to you: medical, religious, anonymous hotline, support group, parents, friends — anything will do. However, suicidal tendencies without a doubt qualify for a good reason to make an appointment with a psychiatrist. This is how I got diagnosed. I needed to get suicidal first to notice that something is not right.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are close to an affected person\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are close to an affected person, give them time. Recovery is a gradual process. Be patient and supportive. They know that they have problems with hygiene, that their room looks like an aftermath of the nuclear war, that they haven't done the dishes in weeks. It's alright. If you can, help them. If you can't, leave them. Time will come when they get up and do all the dishes and laundry in one go.\n",
      "Here, the spoon theory is a great illustration of this particular face of depression (shoutout to Anja Osypova). It is a metaphor that is\n",
      "used to explain the reduced amount of mental and physical energy available for activities of living and productive tasks that may result from disability or chronic illness. The term spoons are a visual representation used as a unit of measure in order to quantify how much energy a person has throughout a given day. It was coined by Christine Miserandino in 2003 in her essay The Spoon Theory. According to her theory, each activity requires a given number of spoons, which will only be replaced as the person \"recharges\" through rest. A person who runs out of spoons has no choice but to rest until their spoons are replenished. However, people with chronic diseases [...] and various disabilities may have sleep difficulties. This can result in a particularly low supply of spoons. (Ctrl+C Ctrl+V from Wikipedia)\n",
      "I hear people call each other tenderly spoony. I think it's cute. So, love your spoony, they can be adorable.\n",
      "My former partner Christoph used to literally drag me out of bed every day when I was at my lowest. He woke me up with the best good morning YouTube playlist and started by shaking all my body parts. It was very funny and so I started my day with a smile. Then he asked me what I wanted to wear. In most cases, I said \"Dragon. I wanna be a dragon.\" So, he went into my room and brought the dragon, socks, and slippers. He took one foot out of the blanket and stroke it. Then he put a sock on it. When he was done with the second foot, he would start putting the dragon on me, while I was still lying flat. Anyway, it was funny. I laughed a lot. Next, he would put me straight up and finish dressing me up as a dragon. I was ready to start a new day.\n",
      "Tell them that you love them and that you believe in them. You might need to repeat it everyday. It is crucial to regularly give the person in depression encouraging affirmation and to cheer them up. On most days in depression, I cry at least once a day. I feel hopeless and worthless. I see no exit in the darkness. My partner was there to console me too. He hugged me, let me cry into his shirt and told me over and over again what I achieved and that I can do more.\n",
      "Once I was about to meet an elderly friend of mine who is usually very proud of me and thinks highly of me. I grew to perceive her appreciation as high expectations. It put a lot of pressure on me. I was afraid not to meet the standards. So, this time, being deep in depression, I got so anxious so that I wanted to cancel the plans. Every time I thought about it, I started crying and couldn't calm down. I felt like a complete failure. But canceling the plans would be a typical failure too. So, I had nothing left to do but to cry.\n",
      "Christoph took an A4 notebook and started going through the recent months with me. He asked me what I did in March, April, May, June, July, and August. Unexpectedly, it turned out that I had done a lot of things and worked a lot of jobs. At least on paper. So, we decided that we killed my worst enemy: I had things to tell about. My plan was to take a shower, put something semi-fancy on and just force myself outside. I would just recite from the chart Christoph and I had made earlier and that would do it. Fake it till you make it.\n",
      "It wouldn't be me if I hadn't blown up my own plan. Soon enough into my report, I got annoyed by the necessity to keep up the facade. So, I told the three ladies that I felt like a piece of shit and that I had been feeling like shit for months and that I didn't see any light at the end of the tunnel. I told them about my disorder, how I got diagnosed, how long it took me to find the medication that's right for me, that I went to a self-help group and that I found friends there. I felt relieved. And the ladies were again amazed by my honesty and strength. Of course, I thought that I didn't deserve it, but it was a huge relief, nevertheless.\n",

      "As far as Christoph is concerned, so that you don't think that I am the luckiest girl in the world — which I was — should be rightly noted that he broke up with me three weeks ago. He couldn't deal with my illness any longer. And I let him go because he deserves it. I am deeply grateful for the time he spent next to me, feeding me off the spoon and putting the dragon on me. But I cannot force this burden on anyone.\n",

      "翻译失败（原文：Manic for 6 months ending up in jail where I had a suicide attempt. 38m.  February 2022, I finalized my divorce.  I had been trapped in a dysfunctional marriage for 7 years.  During those years, I was incredibly stable, but incredibly over medicated.  Towards the end when things were at their worst, I was alone self medicating with alcohol.  During those years, I was on Venlafaxine, Seroquel, and Lamotragine.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February, with a fresh start to life, I started exercising and eating better.   I stayed away from my phone and computer, and I would go out and socialize.  I started looking better and feeling better.  Knowing the side effects of the meds, I started tweaking the dosages.  Seroquel in particular is incredibly sedating, so I thought I could go down a natural route, managing my bipolar with healthy stress management.  I saw improvements.  I had more energy, my rest was better.  I kept lowering the dosages and kept seeing improvements with my mood and energy.  I was aware of the risk of mania, so I was very acute in getting enough sleep, and if I needed to, I would use seroquel more as a PRN.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to June, and this slope lead me to a path where I was completely off all medication.  I was making strides in all areas of my life.  In particular, my relationship with my daughter.  We were having a blast and an incredible start to the  summer with my motivation and optimism for life.  All while this was happening, I was keeping watch on my mania, never denying that it could pop up at some point.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be about when July hit that the first occurrences of mania became apparent in retrospect but wasn't obvious or out of control at the time.  It was the beginnings of losing touch with reality.  Passing interactions with other people, I would sometimes get a hint that I had a larger purpose.  But they were fleeting and rare, so I didn't take notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of July, I was semi-regularly battling against these thoughts that the strangers I would come across would be part of a conspiracy, and that there was some purpose behind their being there.  I was in conflict with myself.  90% of me didn't believe it, and thought it was ridiculous, 9% thought that it was my duty to be humble with getting recognition and attention, and 1% was feeding into the delusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of August, I was getting exhausted with the notion of being at the center of everything.  I hated the idea that I had to be studied, admired, and protected.  I \"knew\" that something was happening on the outside world, and I didn't know if I was seen as a reconciler of religion, science, and all cultures.  I was seen as the person to bring the whole world together and the inspiration of a movement that could potentially solve any problem.  It was seen as the opportunity for aliens to finally make their presence known.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of September, I knew there were reasons that \"the movement\" couldn't directly come to light to me, and I being in a sort of partnership with the movement, I started giving my personal belongings away.  I would donate my clothes, my coin collection, my golf clubs, my old baseball glove, and most of my other stuff.  It was my belief that each item would go to a person in need, and every item would be cherished by someone.  I sort of expected to get something in return, but never did of course.  Or if I did, I stole it thinking I was meant to steal it.  I was also writing and doing art at this point, which I was also leaving behind on purpose in public places.\n",
      "\n",
      "When October rolled around, I quit my job because when the world was following me, I saw my job as a way for me to feel normal for a while.  I didn't want to give up my old life, but I had a higher calling.  It would have been around October 24th when I was completely exhausted from all of this.  I couldn't handle the pressure.  I couldn't handle the fact that most of me still didn't believe this shit, but that brainwashing-propaganda-part-of-the-brain that kept feeding me these thoughts, I was exhausted fighting that all those months.\n",

      "I had the idea to go find some weed.  I never smoked it before in my life.  So, I went to a vape store and asked if they had anything that could get me high.  They gave me a canister and a battery.  I didn't look at it or do any research because with everything being planted and all information to my phone being filtered, there was no point.  I went home, and smoked it.  I went into a panic immediately.  Thinking I was going to die, I called an ambulance.  They came but they didn't seem too concerned when they got here.  I was getting frustrated because they weren't taking this \"emergency\" seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was out of my mind psychotic.  I fell to the floor \"devolving\" from a human to a werewolf, to smaller and smaller mammals up to and including being a microorganism.  I remember \"going offline\" and coming back online a few times.  I remember seeing a coordinate graph where the line kept splicing off the edge, and it felt like I kept dying.   It felt like I was shedding timelines where I actually died there, but I kept surviving in this one.  I remember being in the bed in the ambulance with the EMT, and he would turn from male to female, and I wrestled with the idea of \"male\" and \"female\" at the most abstract level (almost like properties of the universe).  I remember re-living my life organized in different ways, and coming back to the EMT each time, thinking that this is the infinite cycle of existence.  I have only small fragments after that, but apparently I had a \"freak out\" moment in the hospital, and they saw it as me being aggressive to one of the personnel.  I was arrested, handcuffed, and brought to jail, charged with a felony, simple assault on emergency personnel.\n",

      "In jail, my parents were not willing to bail me out without being on meds.  The jail system here is completely dysfunctional, and there's basically no mental health support, so there was no way for me to get on my meds.  After about 3 days living in an open dorm situation, the other inmates took notice of my behavior and obvious mental health issues.  They're bored and destructive people, so they preyed on my mental weakness, and I stayed strong as best I could.  I can't go into every thought I had, but there was a night that I thought my family was kidnapped and were being tortured and murdered one by one.  The inmates were feeding the thoughts, and when it got to my daughter, I couldn't hear anymore.  I went into the bathroom, got as high as I could (about 8 feet), jumped, and pushed off the ceiling trying to land my head on the concrete.  I didn't lean back far enough and landed on my spine.  The pain was intense and I threw up the shampoo, soap, and cleaner that I drank about an hour earlier.  I shit my pants and was writhing in pain.  The officers rushed in to check things out.  I pleaded for them to shoot me telling them it will save my daughter.  I kept begging them to do it.  They told me to get up.  Walking to suicide isolation, I felt reassured that what I did put an end to them murdering my family.  I was in suicide watch for 20 days, which, if someone weren't suicidal, would make someone.  I had no clothes but a velcro towel, and I had to shit in a hole and smash the turd down with my foot so it would go through the bars.  I couldn't have more than a few squares of toilet paper.  Nothing to read.  My bed was the concrete.  I'm not complaining because it is what it is.  It's jail and I was there.  But what was the worst part is the back pain lying on the concrete.  No position felt good, it was simply finding the least painful position and last as long as I could before that became too much, and just keep shuffling to find something that's tolerable for just a moment.\n",

      "After 28 days, there were enough people who got involved that I was finally able to get released on bail with a treatment order.  I got back on my meds, and I've been on them since.  I've slipped into a real bad depression.  The charges were dropped 10 days ago.  I'm resuming my job search (it's impossible to find a job with 'assault' on your record).  The arrest itself can still be found if an employer does a certain background check, but nothing I can do about that.  I slipped into drinking semi-regularly, but I've pulled out of that the last 2 weeks.  All in all, I'm holding on by a thread, but there is hope.\n",

It involves an affair and I'm struggling to absolve myself for my part in it and have thought often that I might die of a broken heart over this. I'll begin with the story fully and what I need from all of you is help to see similarities in me that'd make me a BPD sufferer or her or what.

      "The story begins at work. I worked at a rehab facility in a health field. She was at the orientation for our first day and she said later that I'd caught her eye and she'd hoped to talk to me from the very first time she'd seen me. As I began to see her at work she started casually flirting. Once she needed equipment that'd take blood pressure and I said I only had my POX that does HR and SpO2, she replied \"I want everything\" with a look. As we began to really talk she revealed she had a husband even though she wore no wedding ring. I thought she was beautiful and she was very observant. Later, she said that she noticed me looking at her lips one of the first times we'd spoken. It progressed to innocent things like once I'd said me and a coworker missed her while she'd been off for a week or so. She came up to me later in the shift and excitedly and red in the face said \"you missed me?\" When helping a patient up from bed she'd placed her hand firmly over mine as I held onto his walker. Little flirty things like this intrigued me. I know that I should not have proceeded but I could tell that she was unhappy and I did feel like she was truly deserving of more happiness. She was from Moldova and her husband was Russian. They'd been married for I believe 10 years and had a son who was 5 years old. I began to pursue her a little more and wrote lists of things to do nearby that were fun. Although she'd been in the US for 5 years she'd never been to a movie once in that time. I was so sad and just thought this girl needs to experience the lighter side of life. Finally, one day we exchanged Instagram information and soon began talking on there. She wasn't quick to reveal too much about herself but was definitely initiating conversation frequently. As we began talking it progressed relatively quickly, after a month and a half we were meeting for the first time outside of work. It was around this time that she told me prior to meeting me she'd planned to leave her husband and just be \"alone.\" I tried inviting her to a movie but she kept insisting that she wanted to come over to my place. When discussing this she was talking about seating and how we wouldn't be doing anything and all of that. I told her the TV was in my room and all I had in there was my bed. She was kind of trying to say that there could be no contact and all of that. Well, within seconds of shutting the door behind her we were making out. For the entire time she was over we made out. She even shook my bedpost when she got into my bed. I know she would have gone all the way if I'd tried. This is when there were things she finally said that shook me a little. She told me she broke up with one guy because he didn't kiss good and stuff like that. She told me eventually that people when she worked at Amazon offered a threesome with her. I have no idea how that conversation even began. She began to sound almost manic with the things she'd say as if I'd freed some mind that was eager to be free. She told me once that she wasn't ready to date older men because she wasn't ready for that. When we ate tacos for the first time she said she was ready to date because I joked that all women like tacos and margs on their dating profiles. She told me there were times she thought she loved her husband. It was largely like a business relationship where they occupied separate parts of the house and just worked together for the practical purposes of a relationship (kids, home, money). She even told me he had cameras inside the house that he'd watch and monitor. As I started to become more attached to her I became more nervous and more fearful. It was at this time she made a reference to the effect of me being her favorite person and something along the lines of she'd let anyone go before letting me go (meaning friends etc.)  The situation to me as it began was that this girl was wonderful and I'd have been a fool to let her life go by without joy and happiness. She truly was to me someone very special. One of the first things she texted me on instagram was that she perceived me to be \"less happy than I appeared\" at work. She just seemed so genuine to me but as time went on I feared that maybe I couldn't trust her. She revealed a lot about her childhood but not much about the emotions she felt. Like, I know she had a tumultuous upbringing. She literally lived in a village with a bed that was above a wooden stove that heated it beneath. I know her dad whipped her and her brother. She was unfairly responsible for a lot as a kid. She also revealed she had a bout of bulimia in high school. She told me they were told more often that they did something wrong rather than be congratulated for good work. She didn't like me complimenting her too much. She would try to change the subject if I'd say much to that effect. She didn't like when I gave her positive reinforcement either. Like, if I said I appreciated something she'd say I was trying to train her. One thing I'd said I appreciate was when she sent photos of home. Like, what she was doing or what her son and her were doing. I just liked feeling as if I was included in her life. I spoiled the hell out of her. I brought her food and everything I could each time we worked together (about once a week). What happened though eventually was we had a night together finally a month or so after our first kiss. I did not perform well. The anxiety of it all and the feeling that I was being told when and if things are going to happen. This wasn't like I'm feeling horny and you are right next to me. This was I'm coming over this day and we're going to get it on. I'm 33 and my sex drive isn't quite that great and add in this whole complicated situation and well, it didn't go well. This was the first time she said \"I love you\" though when we were doing other things in bed together. I became nervous about my failure to perform. I didn't discuss with her the reason or anything regarding it so that was likely my mistake. The next time we saw each other and I said I love you, she said \"can we not say I love you so much.\" That shook me because I didn't know what it meant, like holidays? lol I told her to not tell me how to love her and she accepted that although it probably bred contempt. Fast forward a couple weeks and we are in the car after work and I saw her getting close to another coworker at work. This coworker later said he felt \"some vibes\" from her too but once he saw we'd become close he didn't think any more of it. When I saw them two close, I asked her about it. She said \"you doubt my feelings for you?\" She got upset and rightfully so, later that day she was very panicked and called to say that she was shook up by it. Now our birthdays are approaching. I'd thought we'd see each other on my birthday. No we didn't. Then her birthday was the day after mine. Didn't see each other that day either. Then another 5 days or so went by and she didn't come over or anything. Just prior to what happened next she sent me the music video for \"Wicked Game.\" Paranoia took over me and I just asked after a day where communication was kind of lacking between us if she was distancing herself. She told me that no she wasn't distancing herself and that a healthy relationship is two people living separately with separate interests and coming together in the middle to share. Then she said at the time that now she felt worse and that I felt better. Two days later and she called to break up with me and said \"love is not enough.\" That was the blackest my life has ever seemed. I had never experienced anything like it. Like I was just floating through a sea of nothingness. The very next day she texted to say \"she still thought of me\" and that she was worried. I just told her that I couldn't help her feel better about her decision to break up at that time. Almost a week went by and she called me. I didn't answer because I figured if it were important she would have called again. Curiosity got the better of me a couple days later and I called her back. She answered and we spoke, she said that she had to become \"better at disappointing me.\" She told me it would take some time to get back to normal between us but it didn't take long. She revealed that she'd written in the birthday card she got me (but never gave me) that I made her want to have kids again. She later revealed that she feared and projected that I'd be jealous of the time devoted to our children over me. The fantasies continued and she envisioned us growing old together and that we'd \"rest when we were old.\" She is a very hard worker. I've never met anyone so goal oriented in my life. She was truly busy and between her husband not helping her, her son, school and work, she was truly doing it all. I can tell that my persistent need for attention probably bothered her but as I became closer I could no longer act cool. After we got \"back together\" she suggested we go to the movies. I was so happy to finally do something with her outside of work or just spending a night together. Some time to finally bond and enjoy ourselves just sounded great to me. I had a great time and I thought she did too. She said before we went into the movie that she was sorry and that she'd \"never forgive herself\" for what she'd done when she broke up with me. She told me when she'd broken up she stowed away everything I'd given her and deleted our conversation on Instagram. She also revealed that it was a time where she considered going to therapy or doing a virtual session. This was I think one of two times she'd ever say she was sorry to me. I don't remember when it was that she'd said this but it was either before this breakup or somewhere else in the middle of all of this but she said \"I need to love you less.\" That's not a good thing to hear. This period was probably the best time of our relationship. She even entrusted me to watch her son while she went to an eye appointment. It was moments like these that I needed where I actually felt valuable to her. I didn't think much of myself outside of opportunities like this. A week or so after our night at the movies she came over again to my place. When she came over this time I performed better but still not well enough. I think I went like 5 minutes and then just lost it for whatever reason. I'm not a very experienced guy and I never really talked about it with her because I thought she'd think less of me. A few more weeks go by and she says that she can no longer spend time with me after work. We'd have like twenty minutes between us after a shift and of course I assumed incorrectly it was because of me. I needed reassurance probably a little too often. I don't know if it was the nature of the relationship, the first breakup, or what it was but I felt on edge. She assured me it wasn't because of me that she didn't want to or couldn't stay after work. She said her husband found a (innocent) picture that I'd given her of me. I knew that a lot of what I'd given her was stowed away so I wondered how only this picture was found. He then deduced that I was a person on her instagram from my photo. She warned me to not text her and that she'd contact me. This went on for a little while successfully until one morning I sent her a couple of messages on Instagram. He was actually online on her instagram and saw the messages where I'd said \"I love you.\" She didn't contact me the rest of the day so I knew something was wrong. That night I called her and she answered crying. She said that he'd told her she was a bad mother and all sorts of terrible things. He also messaged me the next day saying \"I hear you are very good friends with my wife, I also want to be friends.\" I told her about this and she begged me not to reply and to block him. A few hours later, he had blocked me. She told me he'd even planned to send me pregnancy photos of her. It was truly messed up. This whole situation is, I know. When he blocked me, I wondered why. She told me he was viewing the messages over and over. She told me he was planning to tell his parents and that it would be soon discussed within the family. I never heard much about it after that. My paranoia increased. A few weeks went by and we had some intimate encounters but she still wasn't coming over to spend the night at all. I felt maybe that was due to my inability to really perform but I wasn't sure. After her husband found out though understandably there wasn't as much communication between her and I. Now I waited for her to initiate everything. I waited for phone calls. I waited for texts. One day she texted me precisely before I began work and I said it meant a lot that she did that because it was something she used to do. She told me I was trying to \"train her.\" We never had real quality time together. Work was really the best thing we had between the two of us. This is where it all began to break. One day I exchanged just a couple texts with her (even though it was against the rules) and I never received a call. I had a spell of emotions come over me and I got upset I said some rough things, nothing too crazy. The next day we spoke and I said asked her if she was happy. She said if she still calls and I still answer that we're happy. She then began dissecting what I was really asking and she came to the conclusion that I was actually saying that I wasn't happy. I felt our communication was so difficult and we hadn't spent any real quality time together by this time since the movies and our one night together. She told me she \"doesn't do reassurance.\" She said she'd have to take time to herself and she'd miss me and stuff but she'd not really be speaking to me. The next week or more I just got texts saying things like \"I miss you\", \"can't talk\", \"good morning.\" This went on and on for like I said, over a week. I was getting really affected by it. There I was the other man in this whole thing and I'm wondering how important am I? After all, she has a husband and a life outside of our relationship. She was absolutely my primary partner. I finally got upset and sent her a text that was lengthy and said don't contact me I don't know what is going on, I don't have clarity on anything etc. She must have had my phone number blocked because the next morning I received another \"good morning\" message. So I sent another similar message again. This one was delivered because she didn't say anything at all. I'll admit, I wanted her to fight for our relationship. I wanted her to see how difficult this was for me. I understand that I was wreaking havoc on her life to some extent. I was definitely a hindrance to any stability in her life. Well, after nothing came to me within a couple of days I freaked out. I went back on everything I'd said and apologized profusely and went on and on with a whole bunch of texts and calls. Like a whole bunch. I was so fearful and felt like I was digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole that I'd been responsible for. I still felt I was owed some clarity on her stance with her husband and what was happening behind the scenes but I knew that I was screwing up. After all of this she said it was toxic and that I was frightening her. After she said that I lost it. I was supposed to work with her that night and I called off because I couldn't fathom being near her when she'd said I frightened her. Well, that night she was super pissed. She said that I was acting \"like an 18 year old boy not a 33 year old man.\" She said there was \"no more us at work, no more spending time together, no more talking\", no more anything. I was shook up by this as I'd been by everything before it. I told her honestly that when I'd called off that my manager knew it was because of some disagreement between her and I. I had known my manager for years and she was a friend, so I didn't think much of it. After she said all of this \"there is no more us\" stuff several more days went by and I decided to resign from the job. She talked to me finally a couple days after the day I resigned. When we spoke she said that her dad never understood her mom and she was fearful because I didn't understand her. At the end of the call I revealed to her that I quit the job. She abruptly hung up on me and later told me that she began to cry after I told her I'd done it because of what she said. She later texted me and said she wanted me to \"let her go.\" This where things got really messy. She told me she wanted to \"be single.\" I told her I need time to move on. She replied, \"I will not remind you of myself.\" I told her she could write a letter if she ever had some clarity on all of this. She replied, \"I will not send a letter, I don't like writing letters.\" A few days again went by and I tried reaching out to her. She asked me what I'd done in those few days apart. I told her that I'd done nothing, meaning I hadn't been with anyone else. When we began talking again things got rough, she began trying to lose weight. She asked if it was because I was nervous why I hadn't performed well in bed. I told her that it was but she questioned whether it was her body. She talked about getting breast implants. She told me that the beginning was fantasy and that it'd never be like that again. She once texted me and said that she missed me more than I even knew but that she can't be vulnerable. She said that she needed to learn to love not me. She said so many things during this period that makes me question everything today. I know women can be emotional and I was definitely emotional enough for the both of us but this was next level. After a struggle to see her, she finally said she wanted to see me. When I did I felt just as we always had together. The butterflies and like she was just the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on. She allowed me to touch her intimately when we had this meeting but it was almost the last time she'd allow me to do so. What happened in the weeks following was my job was reinstated because my resignation was never given to anyone above my manager. She didn't forward it so that she could protect my employment in case I changed my mind. When we worked together those next few weeks there was some contentiousness between us. One night she was upset because something regarding her parents' immigration wasn't going well. She did not tell me what it was initially. I always wanted to know what was bothering her and I was sensitive to her moods. My life with her felt so microscopic. Each interaction was magnified. Each gesture became what I'd live with for the next week as we spent time apart. I was often visibly disappointed when she would not share what was going on. She was very good at reading my expressions. She stormed off and when I caught up with her she had her pants hiked up really high near this one male nurse we worked with. I thought something of this because she'd said she did that near me initially when we began our little courtship. Later that night I said I wanted her to be happy. That I wanted to have a \"good time.\" She asked what I meant by a \"good time.\" I said that I wanted to have fun. That we never had any opportunities to just have fun together. It was soon after that I decided to go back to school to better myself and to impress my gf (I guess). When I did so she took one of the classes with me. So we'd have Monday nights together in class. Our job soon closed because the building it was in was no longer going to be serviced. This left us only with our class together. She would never come over ever again to my place after our argument involving work. I did my best each week to spoil her. I made salmon salad that I kept on ice in the car and we'd eat it after class released. I got her a spa package to enjoy so that she could just a take a minute to relax. I really missed her. I really really really missed her. I needed time with her to really bond. Her life was undoubtedly busy but the lack of quality time we had together came off as disinterest to me. I became so attached but so worried about the previous damaged I'd done that I began to spiral. In the class we had a good time initially. There was even one week where he had cancelled class and we had like an hour and a half together. It was great. I felt just happy to finally have uninterrupted time with her. She asked me during that time jokingly if I had brought the salmon salad again for her. Also, I'd gotten her a whole box of candies that she liked since childhood called \"Bounty.\" She asked where they were and why I'd not given them to her. She told me she liked seeing my reaction when I was asked things like this. When I told her I hadn't eaten them because I'd had enough sweets. She asked \"who have you been getting sweets with.\" I just said a friend of mine (Will). I felt so awkward because she had not been paying much attention to me prior to this night we had together. Texts were more sporadic and often mine that I sent weren't replied to. We still spoke every day pretty much but there was never much to talk about. I craved shared experiences and a sense of security. I'd done my part to ruin things but it felt like this was all being sabotaged. One day I called her after I got out of a therapy session and asked her \"how do I ask for what I need?\" I was being starved. I felt overwhelmed by how much I felt I was being ignored. However, I do know during this time she wasn't caring for herself much either. She was irritated when I asked this of her. One night near the very end I offered her a BetterHelp therapy membership. I told her it was the best thing that I could give her. I had already tried brightening her spirits with the spa gift and the other little things I'd tried to do. She said she didn't want to go and that only she could decide when it was necessary to go. She told me she didn't like how I was trying to change her. Another week near the end, I sat next to her in class like always. After class she asked me why my legs were so far from her legs beneath the table. I certainly felt the push/pull behavior. I know she had a lot on her plate but I was single, I didn't have all of these responsibilities and dramas. I was focused on her. A little too much maybe. I didn't know if she'd done this before?? Why the cameras in the house?? Why the invitation of a threesome?? I didn't know if I was really important. My mind raced and raced. One of the final days we had I asked her in a text \"if I ask to spend more time with her, isn't that something she'd want to do because she loves me.\" The next day we spoke on the phone and I asked her to reply to that when she could, she said that I can't ask someone to do that. She'd reply when/if she was ready to do so. I was struggling so much, I have thought at times I might die of a broken heart over this. What finally happened was her son was sick, she told me the day before we had class together that she needed a break and requested that I don't text her. I agreed and the next day we saw each other in class. I broke. I asked her if she'd have any time for us after class, she just shook her head no. I snapped. I began just staring at her, intermittently for a good ten minutes or so. Sulking in the chair next to her, I was probably a real sorry sight to see. She looked to me and said \"we'll talk after class.\" I made some passive aggressive remarks about borrowing a pen and stuff but nothing too bad. When we got out of class I was immediately upset. She patronizingly said \"let's have a discussion.\" As if I hadn't been trying to have one all along about my needs. I said \"did you talk to your husband today?\" She said, \"I have to, he has my son.\" I replied \"well nothing for me then, huh?\" The \"let's have a discussion\" remark made me begin to crack a smile (she did not like that) because I just thought to myself how ridiculous is all of this. I love her, I still do. How on earth could she not see how ridiculous it had all become and how it practically was from the start. The argument went mostly like that for just another minute or so before she began walking away. I followed and she said \"I don't like the way you love. Your love is overwhelming.\" She got in the car and as I tried to offer her a water I had brought for her, she said \"I don't want anything from you anymore.\" She had headaches a lot and one night she drank and ate the ice from the salmon salad on her way home, that's why I had brought the water for her. She went home and I went to meet up with my one friend. I called her and left a voicemail that said something like \"I wish you the best in all the things you have going on. I hope you learn to love and accept love.\" The next day I hadn't yet heard from her and I texted her. When I did she told me that maybe a business relationship is what she needs. She can't handle arguments in love. She told me she went home had a few drinks and considered her husband's proposal to get back together. By that she meant they had sex. She told me that what we had wasn't special, that \"it was in my head.\" One thing she asked was why I smiled. I said, \"I couldn't believe I was being treated like this.\" She replied, \"you're saying I'm a bad partner.\" I said, \"I've been asking you for weeks to see you.\" I just couldn't believe the whole thing. She acts concerned about such a thing after admitting to having sex with her husband. Her mind truly was chaotic. Where was she when I was breaking at the seams over our lack of time together. We have not communicated at all since that night. The last thing I sent was one heart emoji. I had no words from her to say anything about what I meant. Nothing. I have cried so much over the last few months. I think often about the day that I die and if I might be able to call her and see her one last time so that we might be able to imagine what it might have been if we'd had a chance. A real chance. I don't know. I blame myself. I know that I might have a problem. Maybe we both have a problem. I don't know anything anymore. It was real to me. Maybe I was just being used? If I could go back I would have stopped it from progressing as far as it did. I felt my confidence and my security change once it advanced. I don't know what does this mean to you guys on here? I've read a lot of BPD, NARC stuff. Youtube, Reddit, you name it. Do I have a problem? Is how I acted, aside from beginning this affair in the first place, that outlandish? Why didn't she understand how I might feel being in my position? Was this just a natural breakdown of an affair? Did I really mean nothing? How do I move on from this? How was this a genuine relationship with none of the healthy aspects a relationship has. Is it because she has a different outlook on love culturally? Is it because she sabotages relationships. I can't see how any intimate relationship with her could succeed, there doesn't seem to be any consistency. I am so confused. Thank you to anyone who reads and dissects this whole thing. Thanks for any hesitance to pass judgement onto me.）：UNAUTHORIZED USER\n",

      "翻译失败（原文：The hollow self My life is spent largely devoted to work. Between morning prep, commute, actual work hours, and evening prep like laundry, packing lunches, and other small maintenance tasks I only get about 3 hours a day to be myself. After all, I need to be in bed at a decent hour or else I won’t be well-rested for the next work day. That’s it. That’s my life.\n",

      "Meanwhile, even though I’m so devoted to work that I sacrifice the vast majority of my life for it, I’m barely earning enough money to survive. I have over $50,000 in debt that is slowly growing as I struggle to make ends meet. I don’t know if I can ever pay it off. I can pay off maybe 1/3rd of it if I really push hard and eat ramen for the next 6 months. I’m turning 40 in 6 months.\n",

      "At what point am I supposed to go from “surviving” to “thriving”? I know most people earn the majority of their money later in life but I just don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. What is my purpose? Why am I grinding on the world’s worst-ever RPG system? I feel like I’m on an economic treadmill that keeps speeding up every year, and at some point I know I won’t be able to keep up.\n",

      "My job itself is relatively easy, I’m a data analyst at a medical device manufacturer. For the most part it’s just pulling reports for managers and being really good at Excel and Power BI. Though I don’t know if I’m that good at my job. Tomorrow marks 1 year in this position, and every night I feel like I’m doing the bare minimum. Like I’m that guy on the team that everyone else talks about behind his back. I imagine they say things like, “He’s so slow. What’s he even doing all day?” or “I better schedule this meeting because if I wait for him to do it, it’ll never get done.” They don’t say these things out loud of course, and maybe they don’t even think them… but maybe they do. Maybe I’m just treading water but refusing to swim towards the shore. I think I’m ok because my head is still above water, but realistically if I keep doing this I will drown. I need to swim.\n",

      "I just feel like such a loser, all the time. I don’t have kids, and I don’t want them. I’m not married, but I’ve been in a relationship with someone for just over 12 years. We live together. She makes a lot more than I do, so she pays the mortgage and I pay everything else. It’s probably not a fair arrangement for her, but I just literally don’t make enough to split everything 50/50. She earns $40k more than I do a year. She would literally need to pay our mortgage 3x a month just to get to my wage. Then we could split the 4th one, that would make it even. Even with that justification in my mind, it makes me feel like a loser. Not that she makes more than me- good for her! She deserves it! Just that I can’t contribute equally. I feel like a mooch.
